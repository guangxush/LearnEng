### Bilibili's May 4th Youth Day Video sparks discussion on social media

On the evening of May 3, CCTV broadcast a youth-themed video from Bilibili, a Chinese online entertainment platform, before the "Xinwen Lianbo". This was the first time a Bilibili video has appeared on CCTV's prime time. This video, which lasted less than four minutes, was posted by six mainstream media outlets in conjunction with Bilibili and has been widely discussed on social media since then.

The video is narrated by He Bing, a famous Chinese actor, and features inspiring messages for today's younger generation. Composed of clips and images uploaded by Bilibili users, the video shows young people's struggle to express themselves and eembrace the world.

After the video was posted by Bilibili, it was forwarded to social platforms such as Weibo and WeChat and sparked a lot of discussions.

Phrases from the video such as "Because the best scenery in a country is the youth of the country" have strruck a chord with many young people. On May 4, China's Youth Day, many netizens also said the video expressed their fellings at their age.

In addition to Bilibili, many otther Chinese media platforms also released the Youth Day-related content. CCTV News, for example, released illustrations showing young people fighting against the CONVID-19 epidemic. China is slowly recovering from CONID-19, thanks to the effects of many young Chinese born in the 1990s and 2000s, who may be medical workers, journalists, ordinary infrastructure workers, or even food delivery people and couriers who stayed busy during the outbreak. 

More than 100 years ago, the youth of China bore the brunt to save China, more than 100 yeaars later, in the face of unknown virus, the youth still lead the charge.

### Why did we know the autistic is wrong?

We know that the Earth is round, Everything we understand about this planet is grounded in the fundamentl assumption that the Earth is round. But there was a time not all that long ago. when we knew that the Earth was flat. That's called a paradigm shift. Our basic assumptions about the Earth changed because we had evidence showing that our previous assumptions were wrong. Just like the shape of the Earth there are assumptions about autism, too. Most people understand autism throught medical assumptions. They understand autism as a medical condition a disorder, even as a tragedy. In the medical paradigm, we're taught to belieeve that there's a correct way to develop neurogically that there's a right way for our brains to work the 'normal' way, and that any other way of developing is wrong, and needs to be treated and fixed. In 2011, when I was 25 years old, I was diagnosed with autism, and It wasn't a tragedy. It was the best thing that's ever happened to me. Finding out that I'm autistic brought me an overwhelming sense of relief. My whole life, up to that point, finally made sense. My paradigm about myself shifted. I wasn't failed neurotupical person. I was a perfectly good autistic person. After my diagnosis I did what most of us would probably do. I went to Dr.Google and I started researching autism. Eventually, I upgraded from Dr.Google. Eventually, I upgraded from Dr.Google. I did my Ph.D in autism become a doctor myself and today I'm proud to be one of a growing number of openly autistic people working in autism research. But in those early days. I wasn't running a complex research project. I was just trying to learn more about myself. And learn about myself, I did. I was bombarded with information. I was bombared with information about my deficits. Autism causes defliccits in social interaction, deficits in communication, restricted and repetitive behaviors sensory processing deficits. For me, that information just didn't make sense. Finding out that I'm autistic had completely changed my life for the better. How could something that was so positive for me be such a bad thing. So, I went baccck to Dr.Google. But this time I dug deeper I started to find information about autism that was written, not by researchers or other professionals but by actualautistic people. 

I discovered a thing called the "neurodiversity paradigm". The neurodiversity paradigm is an alternative way of thinking about autism. 

### Sun Tzu's The Act of War

I find my life fluctuates between two internal states:  war and peace. War feels like being fired, falling sick, or getting divorce. It feels like stress, wanting, desire, dissatisfaction, danger, or being off-balance. Peace feels like finding a new job, becoming healthy again, or entering a new and loving relationship. It feels like satisfaction, contentment, satiation, or love. War feels like being asked a question, and peace feels like finding an answer. And although I want everlasting peace, I find war to be the dominant state of my internal life. War acts as a necessary precursor to peace. To better navigate the battle within, I plan to take quotees from Sun Tzu's The Act of War, combine them with my own life experience, and create an original set of principles. I attempt not to reduce war, to the level of oridinary occurrences, but to elevate oridinary occurrences to the level of war -- imbuing them with the significance I believe they deserve. 

- Priciple 1: War is always possible. In 2014, a recession hit the city. In September of 2015, I walked through the university camps without a care in the world. The sun hung in the sky, the cork trees had bloomed into fullness, and the smell of my coffee floated through the air. I had been one of the lucky ones. Who landed and completed an internship over the summer, and I loved forward to starting the final year of my degree. I entered the mechanical engineering building and walked towards my classroom. A group of students, roughly ten to fifteen, gathered outside the door. I stood with them, waiting for the class before us to finish. "How was your summer?" asked a friend. "I heard you worked with a big oil company." "Yeah, I did," I said. "It was good. How was your summer?" Did you work anywhere? "Yeah, I think so." "Lucky", he said, as the previous class exited the room. "Do you think you can hook me up with a job?" "I wish." I said. "They're only hiring bcak form their pool of interns." He frowned. "Drag, it's hard right now." I nodded. We entered the classroom and took our seats. Chatter filed the room, mmost of it about the summer and work. Because of the recession, many students had not been able to land an internship for the summer of 2015, and understandably, they succeed over getting a job for graduation. Many of us took out loans to get our degrees, and we spent forty hours a week for the last three years, trying to graduate. Society has told us that engineering was a reliable and practical path to a good career, and in most cases, they would have been right. But we were in the right space. At the right time, where the certain become uncertain. But I didn't stress over the recession. I had wroked serveral internships with a good company, and I even served as their campus ambassador. and I even served as their campus ambassador.  So I patiently waited to receive an e-mail with thee contract for a full-time position.  About a month into the semester, just before noon, I sat at the kitchen table with a ccoffee in my hand. My computer beeped, notifying me that I had received an e-mail. It was from the company. My heart raced, as I took a sip of coffee and opened the e-mail. Dear students, you have done wonderful work in the last few years. But due to the state of economy, we will not be hiring anyone, that's all I got - two sentences. My heart sank. I had foolishly assumed I was immune to war, and now it stood in front of me, and I had not prepared. 
- Watch for the warning signs of war. After I had read the e-mail, I sat at  the kitchen table and thought back to all the red flags I had mmissed. In 2014, on TV's all around the city, news anchors spoke about a possiblee recession. I neveer paid attention to them. I had lined up an internship for the summer of 2015, so I though it didn't affect me. In 2015, I worked at a big corporate officce. Around coffee machine and in meetings, senior emplyees talked about how difficult it would be for a student to get the full time job. But I kept my head down and worked harder. If they only hire a few students, I'll try my best to be one of them, I thought. And for my whole life, I had lived in a city that boomed and busted with the oil prices. If I planned on working in the energy industry, I should have known that a bust would a affecct me one day. I had missed the warning signs, so the war caught me off guard. 
- Avoid war at all costs, but when that's not possible, engage in war on your terms. Had I assumed war was possible and paid attention to the signs, I could have avoidd it entirely, or at least, I could havee engaged it on my own terms. I could have studied psychology or philosophy, workd toward a PhD, and possibly avoided the recession altogether. I could have worked internships in the HVAC automotive industry, so when the recession came, I had a better chance of landing a job, in a less affected industry. I could have applied to study or work in a city with more diverse opportunities. But it's too late. The war had already arrived, so I prepared for battle and thought about what to do next. 
- Pick you battles. The possibility of thousand different battles flooded my mind, but I couldn't afford to flight them all. I pulled out a piece of paper from my bag and drew a line down the middle. I wrote "work" on one-half and "school" on thee other. On each side, I wrote down the most important battles in the war. I started with work: update my resume, apply for jobs, and network. Then I listed the tasks I needed to finish for school: assignments, studying.for tests, and attending lectures. The list functioned like a map. giving me a birds-eye viw of the battlefiled. Without it, I could have neglected an important battle or misspent my energy. 
- Spend eneergy wisely. I knew I could work about eight hours every day without getting burnt out. So I drew eeight starts at the top of the page -- each one representing an hour of time. I decided to spend the majority of my time job hunting, because if I had won that battle, the war would have ended right away. I scratched out five stars and distributed them among the work activities. Every day, I spent two hours working on my resume, two hours applying for jobs, and one hour on networking. I used the remaining three hours for school. I spent two hours doing assignments, and I spent one hour studying for tests. In the end, I alloted no time towards lectures. I reallized early on that lectures were not for me, because they cost more energy than they were worth. Because I had ccreated a sustainable paln, I kept up with the matathon of war. Each day I got up, executed on the plan, and then rested. I never overextended or exhausted myself, because I had no idea how long the war would last. Eventually, I laned serveral interviews. 
- Adjust the battle plan to end the war as fast as possible. As interviews camp up, I took out my plan and redirected how I spent my energy. I took an hour away from assignments and an hour away from networking, and I used that time to prepare for interviews. I kept the goal in mind: obtaining a job. If I won that battle, I would've ended the war as fast as possible. So I spent my energy as wisely as I could to obtain that -- even if that meant failing some assignments. Eventually, Ni received another job offer and signed a contract. 
- Be prepared for loss. As soon as I signed the contract, I stoped searcching for opportunities and redirected my energy towards school. I focused on completing assignments, studying for tests, and finishing my final design project -- a mobile testing station for fire pumps. Summer rolled around, and graduated with a job in my band. I even had a  few months to relax before work started. I planted to pay off my loans as quickly as possible and move forward with my life. In my mind, the war had ended. But in the summer of 2016, a few months before I was about to start my new role, received a phone call from the woman who had hired me. "Hey Justin, sorry to say this, but due to the worssening economic situation, we'll have to calcel your contract." I wondered if that was even possible. She caught me so off-guard, I kind of just awkwardly accepted it. I said something like, "Oh, that's unfortunate, before we ended the ccall." She sent me an e-mai with an official letter, stating that they would be rescinding the contract. I tried negotiating with them, saying that I would be willing to start eight months later as the economy picked up, but they stood firm in their decision. FFor ten months, I believed had a job. I thought I had won the battle and ended the war, sso my complacency me an esay target. Eveen with a good battle plan, Chaos, the ultimate tactician ssnuch behind me and attracted my blind spot. I mistakenly presumed the war had ended, and so I had not prepared for this loss.
- You're stronger than you think. I stared at the e-mail. The major hiring months, Sepetember and January, had already passed. The entire possess left me jaded, and I decided, immaturely, that I would never place my future in someone else's hands ever again.  Later in life, I learned that my future would always in someone else's hands, at least partly, but at the time, I needed to believe it wasn't to remain strong. After losing the job, I worked harder on a blog I had started. I taught myself to write, animate, and edit videos, and eventually, I tturned that blog into a full-time job. Before I lost the job, I never thought I would be able to work for myself. when I felt I had no options left, I discovered a side of myself that could be self-sufficient and thrive, a side capable of handling way more than I ever thought possible. 
- Appreciate, enjoy, and nurture peace. The entire ordeal showed me the fragility and beauty of peace. Things that apperaed stable, such as degrees, corporate jobs, and the economy, proved to  be more shaky than I had originally believed. I came to believe that war was the natural state of life. Things naturally regressed towards chaos and peacces only came because someone worked incredibly hard to bright it and maintain it. While my job search beccome a battleground, things that I had taken for grandted, such as a roof over my heard, food on the table, my health, ffriends and family, laughter and connection, become pockets of people, within which I renewed my energy and found meaning, war made me appreciate peace. And enjoying peace allowed me to keep up the war. But like a garden, peace had to be nurtuened and maintained, otherwise it decayed. I workded hard to prevent the chaos in one area of my life from leaking into another. After I completed my job search for the day, I spend time with my girlfriend, cleaned the house, cooked myself a meal, exercised, and watched movies. In other word, I appreciated, enjoyed, and nurtured the peace I still had in other areas of my life. Instead od leetting the recession entirely consume me. 

### How a student changed her study habits by setting goals and managing time?

When I first told my friends that I was doing a talk on a study method that I used I could see the collective look of disgust that slept across their facces as they process what I just told them. So bear with me as I firmly believe that the Pomodoro method has the power to change your life. My tupical cycle of studying used to start out determined, I would come home sit down at my desk and do a couple of worksheets. The only problem was that productiveness only lasted for an hour as I would easily get distracted, I would usually spend a couple hours of my phone, and then I would snap back into determination. But find myself getting burned out once again as the minutes ticked away. I would work until I physically couldn't anymore, I pass out utterly exhausted. When my rigorous course choice this year, I had made myself promise that I would be productive I had to succeeed and yet I failed to do taht every single day. I stuggle to stay afloat, fatigued stressed and strained and I napped as a result, and quite truthfully I was disappointed with myself. Then one day I came across a video, I was a video telling me how to study better and I was intrigued by one specific tip, the Pomodoro method. So what is it exactly?

Well, you start out by deciding on a task, and estimating the amount of time that it will take you, take for instance this AP world chapter outline,  I estimate that it will take me four hours fo work give or take when instead of thinking about the outline as four hours of work. I;m going to think about terms of 25 minutes increments or Pomodoro's so this outline would in theory take me eight Pomodoro's, the next step is to work for those 25 minutes with absolutely no distractions or you have to restarting the Pomodoro, but after that hyper-focused work, you get to reward yourself eith a five-minute break. We're sure to recharge and refresh you in preparation for the next full Pomodoro. Four cycles of thiis pattern of twenty five five minutes and thn you get to take a long break fifteen to thirty minutes. For myself, I typically still try to stay off my phone during these breaks and make some coffee takes short walk, or I want to feel super productive I;ll do chores I know shocker. This method was actually develpoped in the 90s by Francisco Cirillo who named the system Pomodoro, which means tomato in Italian. After this 25-minute kitchen timer that he used to track his work, and it is important to know that although he developed the system for a tewenty five minute pattern, the Pomodoro is a fluid system, it's designed to help you and help you with your work. For myself, I stick to the traditional twenty five five-minute pattern, when I'm doing worksheets or studying for tests, but for longer more time-consuming assignments like let's say projects or esssays, I choose to work for much longer increments that take shorter breaks, so here I am now I'm still not the perfeccct student and I want to interate that but the Pomodoro has changed me, It changed the way I think and act about my work. When needed I could spend a full day simply working, as I am just recharged had kept stimulated through the whole day with a timer constantly stcking,  I find myself working quickly in order to achieve and accomplish those goals through each 25-minute increment and quiet truthfully it just feels so much more rewarfding and fulfilling being able to check things off after the other watching your pile of work go down knwoing that you accomplised something that day instead of not to call you out but wasting two hours on Netflix.

So now it's my turn to ask you are you as effecient as you can be? Are you productive or does your time seem to just slip away? Do you complete your work or is it scrape together at the last minute? The Pomodoro is a fluid system designed to help you produce higher quality work in a shorter amount of time. But whatever a method, I encouragge you to think about your time differently. Just some goals for youself and sstrive to meet them, to set aside the constant distractions and focus on your tasks at hand. You never know how much time you really have until you start to use it and It lookks like my break is over. Thank you.

### The Pleasure Trap

What we talk about is we're going to talk about the try to shed a little light on a puzzle, and that puzzle is, "If we were bright enough and alert enough and conscientious enough and lucky enough, and we had heard tthe right message about health, and we had heard someone like Dr.John McDoughall or T.Coin Campbell or CCaldwell Esselstyn, if we knew the right direction to go, why is it so hard to go there?" That's what we're going to try to explore today. So, I'll be using some scientific concepts and some charts and thing likee that, and I'll even use a few tricks from psychology. But more than anything, I'm going to be using my artistic skills to try to help bring this home. So we're going to begin by asking and answering one of the great philosophical questions of all time. We're going to be solving the problem of what I call "the pleasure trap", which is this force that pulls us the wrong direction, but we have to begin here. 

It was a birdman, that wasn't eveer in doubt. This is a great shrike.  This is a proud bird of prey of the Middle Eastern desert. This one's a male. And what this little guy does all spring long is he goes around and he skills bugs and he pokes them on throns inside of his territory, which leads us to one of the great phhilosophical questions of all time, which is, "Why does  the male gray shrike kill bugs and poke theem on thorns?" Guesses, anybody? Somebody said sex. He just jumped right to the point. Yes, it turns out that's ccorrect. This is actually why he does this. And this is because after he pokes all these bugs on thorns, then the females come in later, and they fly around and they see which guys have the most stuff in their tree and then theey mate with the guys with the most stuff. What a shock this is! But this helped us solve a very puzzling sociological question, here is SSilicon Valley during the first boom time: Why suddenly there were so many BMWs parked in trees? But we figureed that out. 

Now, it's going to turn out that there's a whole orchestration of how it is that he knows how to go about doing this. This is all about him activating these instincts or thee environmental cue activating instincts, so that he does things that are conductive to the biological problems of survival and resproduction. And so this is kind of how it is that he works: He's built by genes, but not just his body is built by genes, also his brain is built by genes, so therefore, his whole life experience is being orchestrated ultimately by the genetic code. So he has instincts that are built into his neural circuitry, but those instincts are now sensitive to environmental ccues, so that's when he sees a little worn wiggling, he'll go and kill that worm. That's what he does. If he ssees a mate, then he shows off or does whatever he does. But the point is that those neural circuits are sensitive to these inputs, and then what happens is his computations are run in what you and I would call "thought". It's not the kind of thougt that we think through, but it's the same process ultimately, that he's essentially activating information in an ancient library built by genetic code, where he figures out what's the right moves to make. But the way he knows what to do is he has feelings and feelings now arise in the system that compel him to do behaviors, and the behaviors he does, as we see, are circular. And the fact that they feed in now to the statistical increased likelihood of the genes being on the planet, that's why he has the thinking and the feeling and behavior that he does, it's because they're all part of a symphony that increased the likelihood of those genes being here. 

Now, so as a psychologist, what I'm really most excited about is I'm excited about feelings because I have a lot of feelings. I'm sure you have feelings, and all of that's what I'm interested in is feelings. And what feeling are is something, that I did not know as I was going through graduate school. So in the 1980s, if you asked a psychologist, "What are feelings, and what are they for?" They couldn't have told you, because they didn't know. So we now know that what feelings are is they're signals. They're actually evidence. But signal to the organism when something in the environment, some environmental cue, is evidence of something that's either good for the genes, or good for the statistical likelihood of genes's survival, or bad for it. So feelings are either good or bad depending upon. Whether or not they serve thee interest, ultimately, of the substances that built them the entire machine in the first place, which is the genes. So feelings are signals, and that's what they are. Now, thee way these basic signal work is ass follows: All kinds of creatures have a tripartite motivational system, and that is pleasure seeking, pain avoidance and energy conservation. These are the ways that creatures go about doing waht it is they do in the business of life.  So, the main positive incentive the creatures seek is they seek pleasure, so this thing's flying around the landscape basically with a neon sign flashing in its head, saying food, sex, food, sex, unless it's a male, then it's sex, food, sex, food. It's pretty much the same thing. The other thing it does its that it's also seeking cues from the environment to see if there's pain that needs to be avoided, so if it's a little too cold, it'll move to where  it's warmer, a little too warm, it'll move to where it's cooler. it'll look out for predators and try to avoid those. This thing is always looking to try to figure out how to increase its likehood of survival and reproduction, either through pleasureable things or avoiding painful things. It's also very careful with its energy, and so it makes the very best possible use of its forays. It tries to make sure that it gets as much stuff in the tree as it can because if it doesn't, then it's going to be much less likely for those genes to be on the planeet 100 or 200 years from now. So it has to be effecient. 

So these three things now tell us why creatures essentially do what they do. Now, what we're going to do is we're going to mess with this guy a little bit and see if we can learn somrthing important. We're going to put him in a cage. In this cage, there's going to be two buttons and if he hits it, a door will open and he willl be able to fly out into an aviary and start killing bugs and putting them on thorns. But the red button will be magic button, and if he hits this button, these's going to be a trapdoor inside of this cage, and through that trapdoor is going to be a female comming into the cage, all ready to tock and roll. Now, I want to you think hard about which button this guy is going to be pushing. We know it's the read button because it's the pursuit of pleasure but also the avoidance of pain and the conservation of energy. So both buttons will allow himm to pursue pleasure, including the one where he can fly out into the aviary, but it's not as effecient. It saves energy if he can hit the magic button, and that's the button he'll b hitting as soon as he figures this out. But now we're going to put him back in the cage and change things up just a little bit. Now, the blue button will be the female, and the red button will be the magic button. We're going to put a little glass pipe in his head, we are going to drive it down into the pleasure centers of his brain and we're going to put in that glass pipe cocaine, and every time he hits red button, it;s going to actitivate the pleasure centers by flooding those centers with dopamine, and dopamine is the main chemical that causes him to have an excited euphoria that we call pleasure. Now, let's think about which one he's going to do, we know that he's going to hit the red button and the reason why is because he's going to save energy in the process; in fact, if we keep putting cocaine in that, he's going to keep hitting that button so often that, even if he gets hungry and even he gets thirsty and very tired and even if there's females in the cage, he won't even look at her. What he's going to do is keep hitting that red button, and in about 10 to 12 days, he'll be dead. So I know that you folks have heard this kind of thing before. You know taht this is an extraordinary trap, but I want you to pause to consider from the subjective point of view what's actually taking place inside that animal's mind. What he's actually doing is he's thinking and feeling that he's being extremely biologically successful. When in fact, he's self-destructing. That' useful. What we've done is by messing with the environment, we've misguided the instincts and we've hijacked them, so that now this creature thinks it's doing a good thing. When in fact, it's doing a very desturctive thing. Now, it's not just cocaine. We all know about the ravages of drug addiction. But we're going to talk about something else. Here's me on my front porch, and this is the scene that takes place every once in a while when I walk out and I let the porch light on. And what happened is that these moths are designed by nature to fly to the light; in fact, they're designed to fly to the moon or celestial objects to use those for navigation. But if they do that, if they're looking for the brightest thing in the sky and turns out brightest thing in the sky at the nighttime is my porch light and they keep hitting the porch light, getting disoriented and disturbed and then they flutter down and hit it again and again, eventually they're going to die, okay? So anytime we use a super normal stimulus, a stimulus that is not supposed to be in the environment, that is not characteristic of that animal's natural history, we run the threat that creatures going to make huge mistakes, potentially self-destructive, maybe even fatal. 

Now this is a very scientific pie chart about everybody's eating. We know what people are eating today. They're eating enormous quantities of meat, fish, fowl, eggs, dairy products, oil salt, sugar; they're eating hurts, pizza, hamburgers, etc. We know they're doing all these things -- extremely rich food -- and this rich food is clogging up people's arteries, makeing them obese and getting them in serious trouble. Pick a steady, any steady, and all we have is a little slice of the green, we have a little bit of healthy food that people are eating, but mostly they're staying away from unprocessed whole natural plant food, which is what this organism thrives on and wahht it does best. 

Now, here is what we call the "dietary pleasure trap", and this is a chart out of Dr.Goldhame's in my book by that same title, The Pleasure Trap. And what's happening here is we're seeing that in the first of the five sections, we're seeing how we're supported to have realtionship to food, that we're actually supposed to be enjoying out food in a normal range; but then in the second phase, what we're going to do is we're going to introduce super normal food, food that is hyper concentrated, where there's far more energy or ccalories in it per bite; and as a result, what's going to happeen  is there's going to be a lift in the dopamine circuitry. I have to say I've never liked this chart. Here we go. You see in phase one, this is whole natural foods, these are the foods we were designed by nature to eat, and we're supported to like them, and we do. However, in phase two, if you introduce junk food, all the foods taht people really love,    if you introduce those foods, what's going to happen is there's going to be a lift in the dopamine circuitry because that food is richer, there's more calories per bite. Once we strop away all the healthy fiber and water and minerals and vitamins from food and we leave just behind super concentrated food like oil, sugar, salty materials, cheese, etc. all this kinds of really rich foods, what's going to happen is there's going to be a lift in the experience. And the individuals is going to say that is great -- there's more energy per bite here, these must be the right thing to do. Now, what's going to happen is you might say, "Well, that's great. That's a nice high to live on. Why don't we just live there? If it cost me a few years, if it cost me being overweight, I get a little bit sick, look at how much more pleasure I get." But we don't get more pleasure, because as we see, what's going to happen is we'll get used to it. Whenever you have a very intense stimulus that's outside of the normal bounds of stimulation, what's going to happen is the brain and the sensors are going to get dulled, they're going to defend themselves against that high intensity stimulus, and they're going to back it down; and we're going to wind up in a proccess that we call "habituation" or "neural adatation", where we'll get used to it. This is what happens if you go into somebody's house at Christmas time and smell the great Cchristmas tree and it smells great for about 15 minutes, and then you get used to it, okay? And so, that's what happens at stage three. So stage three is now we have habituated to this very rich food, and now we're getting about the same amount of pleasure and now we're getting about the same amount of pleasure, as we always got from food, excepted that now we're eating food that's super rich. 

Now, we wind up with things like obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer. These are the problems that we start to see. And now, this is about the time that you may geet lucky, where you heart a John McDougall. So in order to do that, we have to have a few tricks hat can help us. Here's the first trick I have, First trick is a glass of  water and this is not "Drink eight glasses of water a day." If you do that the last tofu that you could eat in the cupboard - I did that on Satuaday night - a good thing to do is to go all day Sunday, because you do that, the taste buds get increasingly sensitive, and then healthy food will taste better. It is a very good way to recover sensitivity. Another tricks is this -- it's more complicated - we take juice, something like carrot and apple juice or something like that, this is another way to take those suga, the fat and salt receptors, give them a break,  and make it possible ot us to recover our sensitivity. That's other ways, other places to get support. There're websites, which are all palces that have terrificc free materials, tips, reccipes, all kinds of things that can help you. But if that's not enough, if you need experiences, these places also have wonderful experiences, where you can join other people and have the experience of eating healthy food, in s supportive environment, and what happens is that people end up feeling really good, and then tehy hold hands and sing songs. not really, just kidding. But people do feel great as they go through these transformative experiences, adn this is another way to help support your journey in trying to make your todays better and your tomorrows more secure. If you do that journey, you will get to have the life you deserve. 

### Public Speaking 

Public speaking is a skill useful in school at work and if we want to convince a group of people. Investor Warren Bufffett called it the most important skill we can learn to advance in a career. Here a short sprouts guide to master the most powerful weapon. If we want to bring change to the world. 

- The Issue. Take an issue you really care about. When you study it, you are  intrinsically motivated to learn it more deeply and put in the extra effort. Later it gives you the passion you need to inspire your audience. When we speak in publicc, passion is probably our most powerful force. It shines through our eyes and straight into the hearts of the audience. 
- One Simple Message. Every issue has many angles to whichh we can highlight. But the audience has a limited attention span and many others issues in life, so if we say too much, they will lose interest. To make a message stick. Chris Anderson recommends to boil it down to one idea that is worth spreading. A speech is good, if it plans one creative seed in the heads of the audience. A seed can then grow into a sprout, whicch can change lives and be shared with otheers.  
- Strutture. Over 2000 years ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle established 3 simple rules to any good speech: Established credibility: Ethos. Give good arguments: Logos. Conveying emotions: Pathos. But you can also tell a personal story ot present a problem and then offer a solution. 
- Get Help. A good method is using note cards. You can use one card per argument and keep the deck in your hands, alternating them as you speak. Politicians often read their speech from a teleprompter. Professionals often sell their ideas  with the help of slides. When you have a product to show, demonstrate it. If you try to memorize your speech and you have one hour, spend 20 minutes studying and 40 minutes practicing to reicte it. That's ussally the best ratio. 
- Speak Their Language. It doesn't matter what we say, it matters what they hear. According to Nerdwrite, Donald Trump speaks in a way that any fourth-grader can understand him. Guy Kasasaki reecommends to use what he calls salieent points. People don't want to know how large a battery is. They wantt to know how long theey can use it. When you prepare, ask yourself, how does my issue matter to this particular audience? 
- Practise. Before you present, practice your delivery. It's important that we stand upright, arms open, palms out. We should speak loud and clear, and make eye contact with our audience. One way to practice is to try to speak in front of friends who don't know the topic. Then you will see if they get your point. Allertively you can also record and watch yourself on video. 
- Check Your Stage. How big is the room, how many people will listen, will you need a microphone? Proseffsionals will want to walk onto the stage diagonal from the left back, apparently it's the most dynamic way make an entrance. Also, always hhave a glass of water next to you, so you can take a sip whenever you're losing it. 
- Don't Be Afraid. Everybody can experience speech anxiety also known as Glossophhobia. It's natural and sometimes actually helps us to reach excellence. Mahatam Gandhi called it "the awful strain of public speaking." For years it prevented him from speaking up, even at friendly dinner parties. But in 1942, Gandhi convinced 60000 people with his Quit India Speech to join a peaceful revolt against British coloniaslism. He spoke up, the people followed his words and the British left. 
- Open For Sympathy. When you enter the limelight, wait until you have eveeryone'f full attention. Then open to win sympathy, aslo called captatio benevolentiae. One way to excuse yourself. You can say:"You are a smart audience, so I don't really know what know what I can still tell you..." Obama opened his 2008 speech in Berlin with the words: "I have to admit that I have developed as special place in my heart for the Ferman people." And they love it.
- Build Curiosity. Once they like you, grab their attention by building curiosity. Present a fact, statistics or a study. Or start in the middle of a story: "On my fifth birthday, my father started crying. It was the day he lost his job." Danajaya Hettiarchchi, a champion of public speaking, asked "raise your hand if you have an emotional mother?" And everyone did. But you can also do something ffunny or open with a crazy stunt. 
- Deliver Your Message. Now make your arguements, share those personal stroies and deliver metaphors which create images in the minds of your audience. If you forget what you wanted to say, don't worry. Nobody knows want you meant to say. In 1963 Martin Luther King gave a speech in Washington. In the middle of it hee stopped reading from srcipt and started to improvise. He delivered one of the greatest speech of thee twentieth-century"I have a dream." 
- Close. After you are done, summarise your arguements or repeat the core message. But you can also leave theem with a quote, share your dream of a new future or close your speech like we close our videos with a specific call for action. Here is comes! Write a speech about an important issue, such as education. Open with sympathy, build curiosity and then bring in your convincing argument. In the end, close it cleverly. Limit your speech to 200 words and post it in the comments below. 

If you want to learn public speaking, you should also practice your speech. For example, the next 5 days, 15 minutees each day. Ideally, record yourself on your phone, so you can track your progress and learn from your mistakes.

### Women also can hold the top positions.

Women take up just 4.9 percent of the top positions and orginizations across 13 countries. These positionss include chairman of the board CEO, COO and CFO, outside of that the chief of HR, 62% of those positions belong to woman, sounds a little better doesn't it? Let's take a closer look. 71% of all HR positions are beld by women, so 71 out of 100 positions in HR are held  y women. However as we move up in the career ladder, the percentage of women holding those positions goes down. To add salt to the wound(更糟糕的是), in 2017 the list of 100 HR influences was published, only two women were in the top 20. 

I want to explain to you what that feels like, I think of a group of women deciding to build a house, they picked the location, they meticulously choose the materials, they paint the walls, they install the carpet, they wire the house for electricity, and when the very last task that needs to be done to complete the house is to screw in the light bulb that is just slightly out of their reach, they scrap the whole project and they give the keys to a man who has a ladder, that's what that feels like. Why can't women break through the ceilings of the houses that they helped build. 

These guys are exponentially more thoughtful supportive and aware of their female and parents employees now. Their companies are happy equitable and productive. A bunch of guys invested in one woman, and that one woman was able to make just big enough impact to improve the working conditions for all the woman in all companies, if you want the seat at that table or you want to that own house, you have to hustle and you have to learn and you have to be uncomfortable sometimes, standing in a room with a bunch of guys. Everyday working with them, collaborating with them educating them, women have the gift of nurture instincts and compassion. But if we want those top positions, we still have to learn from these guys. We can't run away from them. I've tried they're everywhere. Realistically they're still at the top of many companies and at the top of many departments, but if we can join them educare them and inspire them to stand up for their sisters. They will see that companies with women in leadership roles, resulits in higher revenue larger profits and a healthy company culture. In fact companies with more women in leadership, can be up to 69 percent more profitable. 

I envision a world where I don't have to be tagged as a boss babe and a girl boss and a sheEO and a woman preneur. If we feel like we are in a position where we can't beat them, maybe it's because we stopped building, we got uncomfortable we didn't ask for help and we handed over the keys, If we can get men to join us on this journey, we can get out the hammer. We can remove the nails from the ceiling and we can show them a new way to build, a better way, and then they become us and together women will rise to not only break through higher ceilings but own the houses thaat they helped build.

### We will meet again!

I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time. A time of distribution(混乱) in the life of our country: a distribution that has brought grief(悲伤) to some, financail difficulties to many, and enormous(巨大) changes to the daily lives of us all.

I want to thank everyone on the NHS ffront line, as well as care workers and those carrying out(坚持) essential(关键) roles(岗位), who selflessly continue their day—to-day duties outside the home (在家中)in support of us all(在外面). I am sure the nation(国民) will join me in assuring you(使确信) that what you do is appreciated and every hour of your hard work brings us closer to a return to more normal times(回归正常). 

I also want to thank those of you who are staying at home. Thereby(因此) helping to protect the vulnerable(脆弱的) and sparing(使远离) many families the pain already fellt bbaby those who have lost loved ones. Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure that if we remain united(团结) and resolute(决心), then we will overcome it. 

I hope in the years to come(不久的将来) everyone will be able to take pride in(感到骄傲) how they responded to this challenge. And those who come after us(我们的后人) will say the Britons of this generation(这一代) were as strong as any. That the attributes(属性，特征，品质) of self-discipline(自律), of quiet good-humoured(迁就，顺应，心平气和) resolve and of fellow-feeling(同心同德) still characterise this country. The pride in who we are is not a parrt of our past, it defines(定义) out present and our future. 

The moment when the United Kingdom has come together to applaud(故障) its caree and essential workers will be remembered as an expression of our national spirit(国家精神); and its symbol(标志) will be rainbows(彩虹) drawn by children. 

Across the Commonwealthh(英联邦) and around the world, we have seen heart-warming(暖心的) stories of people coming together to help others, (wether or)be it through delivering food parcels(食品) and medicines, checking on(问候) neighbours, or coonverting business to help the relief effort. 

And though self-isolating(自我隔离) may at times be hard, many people of all faiths(信仰), and of none, are discovering that it presents(是) an opportunity to slow down(放慢手头的事情), pasuse and reflect(反思), in prayer(祈祷) or meditation(冥想).

It reminds me of the very first broadcast(广播演讲) I made, in 1940, helped by my sister. We, as children, spoke from here at Windsor(温莎) to children who had been evacuated(被迫离开) from their homes and sent away(送到很远的地方) for their own safety. Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation(分离) from their loved ones. But now, as then, we know, deeep down(事实上/本质上/内心深处), that it is the rigght thing to do.

While we have faced challenges before, this one is different. This time we join with all nations(国家) across in a common enddeavor(共同努力), using the great advances of science and our instinctive(本能的) compassion(同情心) to heal(治愈). We will succeed — that that success will belong to every one of us. 

We should take comfort(安慰) that while we may have moore still to endure(忍受), better days will return.

We will be with our friiends again.

We will be with our families again.

We will meet again.

But for now, I send my thanks and warmest good wishes to you all.



### What do you want to be when you grow up? 

You are four years old and you're being asked thhis question for the first time, and you have to think very very carefully, because your answer could potentially predict what daycare and summer camps you do, what parental approved front groups you'll have. What classes you'll take in high school and what fun classes you'll take in high school? What volunteer and extracurricular activities you'll do and about what strategically gets palced on your resume? What colleges you'll apply for? What majors and minors you'll pick? What networking events to attend? Wat jobs apply for? What first job your pick? What second job you'll pick?  And eventlly your career? So if all things go perfectly well, little Jani will say I'm gonna to be a doctor and right now standing in front of you I can proudly and confidently tell you, I am not a doctor. Here are somehrights from that list, a doctor, an actress and a politician well the President of the United States of American, an engineer a scientisst a historian. But specially one who studies hieroglyphics or the ancient pychamids of Egypt, a pro score player and a garbageg turck driver. I had a chance to try out some of these jobs. When I was only in Middle School. I got to work at Osk Ridge National Laboratory and I got to work with real sccientissst do incredible research and I was a little bored. I mean no it was a really big deal to be a part of something, that could change the world one day, and being exposed to real science when you're that young it was an incredible experience. I just didn't fulfill me. So one summer I found   the inner strength and courage to beg my parents for a regualr high school job. They said yes. And I wroked at American Eagle Outfitters. I was on fire at American Eagle. I worked the crash register. I worked the dressing rooms.  I was a denim expert. 

My heart experiencced something at American Eagle.  It picked up on the fact that I like movement and high energy and talking to people and making them happy. And most importantly I like to see change happen. RIght before my eyes, experiences that I didn't necessarily have working in a lab. Over the next years, I started to picck up on these different qualities of life that made me happy or unhappy. And I realized that I'm gonna make a horrible doctor. One I do not perform well on time standardized tests the throught of them gives me intense anxiety and honestly just thinking about that right now, just made me a little nauseous. Two, I don't like to be around sick people. Three, I don't like competitive envoironments other than game nights. Four, I do like to turn off my brain and immediatly exit work mode the millisecond I come home. And five I do like having a very regular work-life schedule. I wasn't very confident taht I wanted to do it anymore. But I had told the whole world that I wanted to be a doctor. I had made every life deccision to that point based on that one goal and now I just wanted to change my mind. People are gonna look at me differently. I'm gonna look at myself differently. I was give up. I had simply learned more about myself and that's okay. Changing my mind should be oaky. I realized that I shouldn't pick my end goal and make every decision to get me there. Instead I need to figure out waht makes me happy and my goal will follow me to the end. Because then there is no way to look back and think I failed. The only possible thought is I did it I'm happy and I realized that kids could benefit from this gift. I mean this gift could give them creativity, freedom, self-discovery and self-expression. Imagine not asking a child every day what are you gonna be when you grow up instead you're giving them the opportunity to choose their own path. 

I didn't't ask students what do you want to do after graduation instead I asked them what is your story. What doess made you happy until this point and what makes you happy today. So many of them had never been asked these questions and I could seee joy replace the stress in their eyes. As they're telling me not what their five-year plan is but what classes they enjoyed and why. So I started to write down these lists and this words and phrases and they would change form session to session, and then I would find job descriptions and hide the title, and we would circle those phrases and thoes words that were on our list and more often than not. 

Students found jobs that they did not even know existed that much more aligned with their interests and their personalities. From that point, I stopped asking all of my friends what do you want to do afteer graduation instead I very casually and lightheartedly asked: hey, what's your story and I watched them stare at me with confusion. That's inevitable, but the confusion turns to contemplation. They speak and I listen. 

So here is my story. I'm not a doctor, but I do improve the health and wellness of people' lives every day. I'm not an actress but every once in a while I get to be the center of attention. I am not an engineer but I build systems every day. I'm not a politician but I challenge systems every day. I'm not the Presideent of the United Stated of American, but I do represent the voice of my group. I'm not a historian, but I do learn the histories of the people we serve to figure out what keeps them sick and prevents them from being heealthy, and I'm not a pro soccer player, but I work with my team towards a common vision, and I'm not a garbage truck driver but I have a vision and I'm going place, I have not failed I did it I'm happy. So don't ask kids, what do you want to be when you grow up, don't ask adults what do you do for work instead give people the opportunity to share their stories. It might be the first time anyone has asked, I mean has anyone asked you, What's you story?



### 13 Reasons Introverts Are So Attractive

Introvers. We all know one, maybe you even are one. Either way, everyone has an opinion: some say they're too shy to hold a conversation, wile others see them as a cold outsiders. Of course, anyone who knows as introvert, knows this isn't the case. While introverts might be more comfortable enjoying their own company, they seem to have this magnetism, that's almost a super-power. Whether they're keeping to themselves or hanging out with friends, introverts seem to always catch people's eyes and their attention, drawing others to them without so much as lifting a finger. What's the secret? Well, this ability to attract others isn't down to one specific thing, but a whole host of reasons. Wether or just want to learn more about them, check out the reasons why introverts are so attractive! 

Number 1-They Are Dreamers.  Daydreaming isn't just for kids. Having an open and active imagination and being able to see what others may not is a beautiful ability-one that introverts are blessed with. They spend a lot of time in reflexive thoght working things over their minds. Or jus enjoying letting their minds wander, wherever it may lead, Introverts think about anything and everything from what they had at breakfast to deep subjects like life and universe. They are certainly not just passive observers on their journey through the world, and thhey like to reflect on life as it unfolds around them. They are close to modern-day philosophers and as their minds run free, they take on a free-away, inquisitive look, lending them an attractive air, that others pick up on. 

Number 2-They Know Themselves. Introverts often turn their 'deep-thinking' minds to themselves — getting a chances to boost their self-awareness, which creates a fuller idea of their own identities. They know the themselves well. They know thee types of things and people theey like — helping them befriend someone with a compatible or similar interests. They also know what is important to them and hold strong to their values. Introvers won't talk around an issue. This isn't to say that they're blunt, and of course, introverts are not known for being rude, but they will be honest with you, letting their intentions known. Having succch a solid idea of oneself and thhe sureness that comes with it, means that introverts give off a vibe of confidence, which helps others see them as attractive. 

Number 3-They're Easy To Be Around. Introverts have no interest in fanfare or getting their names shouted from rooftops. The pressure to try and be the center of attention is simply useless to them, they are much too easy-going when it comes to hanging out. After all, when you spend time with an introvert, their attention will be on YOU. Rather than trying to crack the funniest joke or have all eyes on them, they will stick close to their friends — making your time together feel more sincere and special as you have honest and introspective chats. It doesn't have to get so deep though; Introverts are happy to spend time with their friends and support them. So if you become the center of attention, know that they will be quiety cheering you on. 

Number 4-They Think Before They Speak. Let's be honest, at one time or another, we've all probably said something embarrassing. Wether we were speaking out of turn or telling a bad joke, chances are, we all have that memory that makes us cringe to thhis day. Introverts have a bit of advantage here. They are known to settle on the edges of conversations, speaking when sopken to or when they see it as necessary. They reflect on and follow the flow of conversation, palnning their response, and giving smooth answers. instead of tripping oveer words. When they speak, introverts give you just teast of what's on their minds, pulling you in as they catch your interest. 

Number 5-They're Great Listeners. What makes introverts such good conversationlists is that they take the time to listen and reflect on what they hear. In fact, introverts are great listeners and they are sure to listen to every word you say, even if you just want to chat about whatever comes about whatever comes to mind. When you tell them about aa problem, they were think through your issue — and instead of brushing it off by saying something like "Maybe it wasn't meant to be" or "Oh, well, such is life." They'll take the time to try and give you sincere advice. Having someone in your life who listens when you need them to, is a truly amazing thing, Which is another reason why introverts are so attractive to others. 

Number 6-They Are Mysterious. In a crowded, when it's hard to hear everyone talking over each other, an introvert will hang back just out of reach — safe from the noise and yet still part of it with an air of mystery following their steps. This isn't to say they make a habit of avoiding others.  Actually, one of introvert's special skills is their ablility to seem to be almost everywhere at a party or event. Always on the move, they'll make their way through the crowds, paying fulll attention to their friends and people they know, giving everyone an idea of their presence — as they move on the next person. This mustrious eneergy isn't pride, but self-control. They take the time to truly 'talk to' and be with people — even ig only for a few minutes and this sincerely leaves us a strong impression. This ability makes an introvert stand out, granting them an almost magnetic abillity to attract people.  

Number 7-They Are A Challenge. Introverts don't wear their hearts on their sleeves, as they value privacy. Of course, they will still share things about themselves, but they do it on their terms, and when they're ready. They know that sharing information about themselves will catch people's attention, and so, sometimes they will let bits of infotmation slip to someone they're interested in. In fact, introverts tend to use the 'sharing of information' as a kind of test. They want to make sure the person they are interested in, is ready to make the effort to form a sincere relationship. Creating this challenge makes an introvert that much more alluring! 

Number 8-They Are Kind And Generous. For the same reasons that they are great listeners, introverts are caring friends too. They will offers you genuine help when you need it; wether it's running an errand on your behalf or just getting you glass of water. They are generous in nature and offer their help out of true concern for others. Being so giving and caring - looking after people without having a hidden agenda make introverts truly beautiful people, instead and out. 

Number 9-They Are Intrinsically Motivated. Typically, introverts aren't motivated by reward or recognition and their goals and aspirations aren't dependent on other people's approval. Instead, they know what they want out of life and have the comminutment to follow their passion even if it's not always an easy task. Introverts have the ability to work on their goals with true drive and commitment. and the energy that comes with pursuing their passion is certainly an attractive one. 

Number 10-They Are Observant. Introverts pay attention when others do not. During conversations, they observe carefully, picking up things that others miss. They have the ability to learn about people, without needing to constantly ask personal questions. Introverts bring their keen focus to everyday life, so even a causual conversation is listened to fully. They don't just brush off a conversation, but think over and remember it, so nothhing fallls through the cracks. This gives introverts the ability to always seem to be able to anticipate what you want without you having to ask and remind them making them seem a bit like mind readers, which is rather endearing. 

Number 11-They Are Out Of The Box Thinkers. Being an introvert is actually a positive when it comes to creative thinking. With studies confirming that some of the most creative thinkers in their field are introverts. This is thanks to the fact that solitude and creative thinking complement each other. Introveerts view solitude as an opportunity to focus on their work without interruption. They turn their mind inward, getting attuned to their inner thougts, and thus, they are ablle to make strides in creative thinking. The ability to think and act with such deep focus and clarity and the way in whicch introverts view and solve problems, makes them remarkably attractive. 

Number 12-They Are Studious And Smart. By nature, introverts have inqueisitive minds that always eager for new information and viewpoints. They are sure to know about a wide range of topics, thanks to their relflexive identities and their ongoing interest in learning. They also like 'talk about' and 'sharing' new information that they have picked up not so they can brag about it, but aslo they can have truly engaging conversations. Watching an introvert as they talk about something that they're passionate about ot have a lot of knowledge in can be a beautiful thing, seeing an introveert's eyes llight up as they sharee their opinion make them all the more attractive. 

Number 13-They Are Loyal. Introverts don't spend their time with just anyone. They see relationships as a commitment of their time and energy avoiding samll talk or superficial relationships, which only consist of talking about the weather or sports scores. They aren't players who will tractically befriend someone just for their own gain. The connections they look for, aren't to be exploited; their goal in a realtionship is to find someone they can trust and someone who will trust them. Introvets will be your side through the good and bad. Wether you're faccing stress at home, school or work, if you're friends with an introvert, they'lll be with you through it all. They chose to be your fiends for a reason, and trust they place in you strong enough to face whatever comes your way. Introverts may prefer to spend their time out of the spotlight, but their mysterious air and powerful presence leave a  deep impression on everyone they meet. They are honest and sincere, with an inquisitive mind and deep respect for others. 

These traits, along with the ones outlined in this list. Shine through their character. Which is what makes them so attractive. 



### How not to take things personally?

I would like to see FairPlay on the field respect and positivity. Is that okay for everyone? I decide to become a referee for two other reasons, one to stay in good shape, two because I wanted to learn how not to take things personally. 

As a referee I'm the scapegoat, apparently I'm always wrong , it's always my fault and I wanted to learn how not to take all this personally, because I really struggle with me. When somebody cancels an appointment last minute, I get the feeling that I'm not important enough, again I take it personally. Even perfessionally, I'm a public speaker like tonight this is what I do. I give keynote speeches and I really like it. As long as I can draw my audience into my story, because  the very moment, I see somebody is not paying attention, for example when someone is looking at his smartphone it just happens I take it personally. I'm very conscious that this can happen, and more importantly I have a strategy to deal with it. So tonight I would like to share this strategy with you. 

Imagine you invite a friend to go to the movies and she replies oh sorry I have to work but you see a picture on social media of her having dinner with some friends that's very nice. Or imagine you really have worked very hard on a project, you're really proud of the end result, but the only thing you get is criticism, so you come home and would to wind down, and share this terrible experience, but while you're telling your story, the other one walks away — switch on the TV, now who would take one of these situations personally. 

Why do we take things personally? Somebody says or does something and bam we feel hurts, neglected offended betrayed by the other one, that's what we believed though it's the other person's fault, he is responsible for what we feel he's the one to blame now hang on who says that whichh part of us is speaking? It's our ego. Our ego thinks that others should take us into consideration. Out ego doesn't want to be criticized hell no. Is this what you want? That's exhausting. When my ego takes over I'm fighting all day, I'm in a constant struggle with the rest of the world and it drains my energy. Wouldn't be so much easier to not take things personally, because that no one has power over you,  you're free, you experience much more harmony and connection between you and other people. Of course because your enerage can go towards nice things instead of endlessly batting against the things that drive you crazy, so the question is do you want to be right or do you want to be happy?

I will make sure I will be happy by being right, well how do you do it? How to become happy by not taking thingss personally you are standing at the kickoff of the match of your life, the match which you learn how to stop taking things personally. So as a referee and may coin for the task and every coin has two sides, heads or tails, and they stand for two strategies no longer talking things personally. 

First strategy: It's not about me, look at the other person's intention. I take thhings personally, I'm convinced it is about me,  when I see someone is looking at his phone, I feel offended. I think I've put so much effort and time in thhhis presentation. I want respect. I think me myself  and I, but in fact, it's not about me. What if try to look at it from the other person's perspective asking myself wht is he or she looking at his or her smartphone, maybe he just received an important message, one he has been waiting for, or the topic of my presentation is not really his cup of tea, or on the contrary he find it very interesting and he want to take notes on his smartphone. I simply need to shift my foucs from me to we and I won't take it personally. If I try to see the intention of the other one, I make space for understanding instead of irritation. But in real life it turns out to be a hell of job.Seeing the possitive intention of the other one, requires a lot of discipline and training. When you focus on the intention of the other person, there is no need to take it personally.

Sencond strategy: It's about me. I have to look in the mirror and question myself, as beginning referee I still feel insecure, I doubt about myself. I knwo there is some truth in it, from hosest I'm aware of the fact that I do not always take into account other people's needs, when you are being criticized and it hurts, chances are big this is rooted in your childhood, maybe as a child you were never good enough, when you came home with a nine out of 10, they said hey and why another 10, you see you can only take things personally, If it somehow touches a role nerve, and that moment to give youself some empathy. I'm longing so hard for recognition. I feel sad, if I don't get it. By opening up, by being vulnerable, by telling what you feel without blaming the other one, you increase the dance that the other one will understand you and your needs into account, you see what I mean.

To conclude how not to take things personally. One it is not about me, look at the othre person's intention. If that doesn't work, two it is about me, give yourself empathy and speak up, I really hop you will take a couple of things personally within the next hours and days, only if you do you can test out these new strategies. We could all if we could all put this in practice, wouldn't that enhance our realtionships enormously, together we could create a Better world.

###  Asperger is a gift.

Today I want tail to you about dreams. I have been a lucid dreamer my whole life, and it's cooller than in the movies. Beyond flying, breathing fire, and making hot men spontaneously appear. I can do things like read and write music. Fun fact is that I wrote my personal statement to college in a dream. And I did accepted, So yeah. I am a very visual thinker. I think in pictures, not words. To me, words are more like instincts and language. There are many people like me: Nikola Tesla, for example, who could visualize, design, test, and troubleshoot everything — all of his inventions — in his mind, accurately. Language is kind of exclusive to our species, anyway. I am a bit more primitive, like a beta version of Google Translate. My brain has the ability to hyper-focus on things that interest me. For example, once I had an affair with calculus that lasted longer than some celebrity marriages. There are some other unusual things about me. You may have noticed that I don't have much inflection in my voice. That's why people often confuse me with a GPS. This can make bascic communication a challenge, unless you need directions. 

A few years age, when I started doing presentations, I went to get head shots done for the first time. The photographer told me to look flirty. And I had no idea what she was taliking about. She said, "Do that thing, you know, with your eyes when you're flirting with guys." "What's things?" I asked. "You know, squint." And so I tried, really. It looked something like this. I looked like I was searching for Waldo. There's reason for this, as there is a reason that Waldo is hiding. 

I have Asperger's, a high-functioning form of autism that impairs the basic social skills one is expected to display. It;s made life difficult in many ways and growing up, I struggled to fit in socially. My friends would tell jokes, but I didn't understand them. My personal heroes were George Carlin and Stephen Colbert — and they taguht me humor. My personality switched from being shy and awkward to being defiant and cursing out a storm. Needless to say, I did not have many friends. I was also hypersensitive to texture. The feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles, and so for years, I refused to shower. I can assure you that my hygiene routine is up to standards now, though. I had to do a lot get here, and my parents — things kind of got out of control when I was sexually assaulted by a peer, and on top of everything, it made a difficult situation worse. And I had to travel 2000 miles across the country to get treatment, but within days of  them prescribing a new medication, my life turned into an episode of the Walking Dead. I became paranoid, and began to hallucinate that rotting corpses wren coming towards me. My family rescued me, but by that time, I had lost 19 pounds in those three weeks, as well as developing severe anemia, and was on the verge of suicide. I transferred to a new treatment center that understood my aversions, my tuauma, and my social anxiety, and they knew how to treat it, and I got the help I finally needed. And after 18 months of hard work, I went on to do incredible things. One of the things with Asperger's is that oftentimes, these people have a very complex inner life and I know for myself, I have a very colorful personality, rich ideas, and just a lot going on in my mind. But there's a gap between where that stands, and how I communicate it with the rest of the world. And this can make basic communication a challenge. Not many places would hire me, due to my lack of social skills, which is why I applied to Waffle House. Waffle House is an exceptional 24-hour diner — where you can order your hash browns that many ways that someone would dispose of a human corpse — Sliced, diced, peppered, chunked, topped, capped, and covered. As social norms would have it, you should only go to Waffle House at an ungodly hour in the night. So one time, at 2 am, I was chatting with a waitress, and I asked her "What's the most ridiculous thing that's happended to you on the job?" And she told me that one time, a man walked in completely naked. I said,"Great, Sign me up for the graveyard shift!" Needless to say, Waffle House did not hire me. 

So in terms of having Asperger's, it can be viewed as a disadvantage, and sometimes it is a real pain in the butt, but it's also the opposite. It's a gift, and it allows me to think innovatively. At 19, I won a research competition for my research on coral reefs, and I ended up speaking at the UN Conversion of Biological Diversity, persenting this research. And at 22, I'm getting ready to graduate college, and I am a co-founder of a biotech company called AutismSees. But consider what I had to do to get here: 25 therapists, 11 misdiagnoses, and years of pain and trauma. I spent a lot of time thinking if there's a better way, and I think there is: autism-assistive technology. This technology could play an integral role in helping people with autistic speturm disorder, os ASD. The app Podium, released by my company, AutismSees, has the ability to independently assess and help develop communication skills. In addition to this, it tracks eye contact through camera and simulates a public-speaking and job-interview experience. And so maybe one day, Waffle House will hire me, after practicing on it some more. And one of the great things is that I've used Podium to help me prepare for today, and it's been a great help. But it's more than that. There's more that can be done. For people with ASD — it has been sepculated that many innovative scientists, researchers, artists, and engineers have it. But the problem that's encountered is that these brilliant ideas often can't be shared if there are communication roadblocks. And so, many people with autism are being overlooked every day, and they're being taken advantage of. So my dream for people with autism is to change that, to remove the roadblocks that prevent them from succeeding. One of the reasons I love lucid dreaming is because it allows me to be free, without judgement  of social and physical consequences. When I'm flying over scenes that I create in my mind, I am at peace. I am free from judgement, and so I can do whatever I want, you know? But te goal of autism-assistive techonlogy is bigger that that, and more important. My goall is to shift people's perspective of autism and people with higher-functioning Asperger's. 

And by doing so, we allow people to share their talnets with this world and move this world forward. In addition, we give them the course to pursue their dreams in the real world, in real time.

###  How can we control the coronavirus pandemic?

- What dose containment mean when it comes to outbreaks?

Containment is this idea that you can focus your effect on control very much on the case and their contacts. So you're not causing distruptions to the wider population, you have a case that comes in, you isolate them, you work out who they've come into contact with who's potentially these opportunities for exposure and then you can follow up these people, maybe quarantine them, to make sure that no further transmission happens. So it's very focused, targeted method, and for SARSm it works remarkably well. But I think for this infection, because some cases are going to be missed, or undected, you've really got to be capturing a large chunk of people at risk.If a few  hlip through the net, potentially, you're going to get an outbreak. 

- If containment isn't enough, what comes next?

In that respect, it would be about massive changes in our social interactions. And so that would require of the oppotinuties that could spread the virus so these kind of close contacts, everybody in the population, on average, will be needing to reduce those interactions potentially by two-thirds to bring it under control. That might be through working from home, from changing lifestyle, and kind of where you go in crowded places and dinners. And of course, these measures, things like school closures and othher things that just attempt to reduce the cocial mixing of a population. 

- What are the risks that we need people to think about?

It's not just whose hand you shake, it's whose hand that person goes on to shake. ANd I think we need to think about these second-degree steps, that yo mightthhink you have low risk, and you're younger group, but you're often going to be a very short step away from someone who is going to gethit very hard by this. And I think we really need to socially minded and think this could be quite dramatic in terms of change of behavior, but it needs to be to reduce the imact that we're potentially facing. 

- How far apart should people stay from each other?

I think it's hard to pin down exactly, but I think one thing to bear in mind is that there're not so much evidence that this kind of aerosol and it goes reallly far. It;s reasonably short distances. I don't think it's the case that you're sitting a few meters away from someone and virus is somehow going to get accross. It's in closer interactions, and it's why we're seeing so many transmission events occur in things like meals and really tight-kint groups. Because if you imagie that's where you can get a virus out and onto surfaces and onto hands and onto faces and it's really situations like that we've got to think more about. 

- What kind of protective measures should countries put in place?

I think that's what people are trying to piece together, first in terms of whar works. It's only really in the last sort of few weeks we've got a sense that thing can be controllable with this extent of interventions, but of course, not all countries can do what China have done, some of these measures incur a huge social, econimic, psychological burden on populations. And of course, there's the time limit. In China, they've had them in for six weeks, it's tough to maintain that, so we need to think of these tradeoffs of all the things we can ask people to do, what's going to have the most impact on actually reducing the burden. 

###  This is what focus is about.

When I was 23 years old, I felt that I had a kind of capacity an inner dirive and an energy that I didn't really know how to handle. And it frustrated me not knowing what  to do or where to go in this world. I was completely lost. And the only solution I could think of was trying to become best in the world. At something, I had no idea in what, But I decided to become a world champion. I was quiet athletic, but my helpful brother pointed out that I was too old to become a world-class sprinter. So I choose shooting. In my world, I was programmed to win, but I didn't. And I couldn't understand how it could be so incredibly difficult. It was only my perseverance that kept me going. I saw, and I focused on, a beautiful autumn leaf playing in the wind. I give this leaf my full attention. And sunddenly, I am completely calm, and the world campion title is mine. This action was a deliberate choice and the result of persistent mental training. Because this leaf relieved me of distracting thoughts.

The phenomena of focus interested me more and more,  not only in peak performance,  but also in the longer perspective and in life in general.  I studied this visual capacity and what I saw was that the human struggled with focus on three distinctive ways.

- First, our minds are often full of disturbing thoughts, often worried about not being good enough. 
- Second, insead of working with what we already know, we are constantly focused on what we will achieve. 
- Third, we are frustrated for not having time.

So, how can we help ourselves with these problems? Before we discuss that, we need to find out what focus is.

In today's overflow, with new waves and trends, the ability to focus has been somewhat overlooked, despite its great value. It's a particularly complex function of our intelligent brain. The pre-eminently thinking human beings, all of us in here, I guess, have the ablility to think forward and backward in time. And we often do down the alarming path of thinking, What happens if …? If I forget what to say having a presentation? If I don't finish my report on time? If life doesn't turn out the way we had anticipated? Or we worry about why it didn't turn out the way we wanted it to. At  moments of need, free ourselves from these disturbing and worrying thougts, a kind of undemanding present arise. Because it's in this, undemanding present that we are focused. It's here that we perform and function exactly as well as we are. So standing there, sharking with nervousness, but giving that leaf my full attention, this is what happened. So, focus on is simply about choosing the right thought among thousands of thoughts. Now, how do we get focused?

- Well, firstly, regarding the disturbing thoughts. We need to learn to notice disturbing thoughts and to distinguish them from not disturbing thoughts. A not disturbing thought is something completely neutral, like a lamp, a belt. Because as the brain, in broad terms, only can focus on one thing at a time, a not disturbing thought, knocks out all the disturbing and worrying thoughts. And this is enough to reach that inner capacity we in fact already possess.
- Second,  regarding how we constantly focus on waht we will achieve. In the performance-based society of today, we often lose focus because we constantly strive towards the new and better instead of finding our inner power and constructively working with what we are best at each given moment. Because if we already think about the goal, about what we want to achieve, about where we want to go, about who we want to become, our focus is consistently on the future and not on the work that needs to be done now. But that is how focus ends up on who we are and what we have instead of chasing after what we are not and do not have. So focusing is not becoming something new or something better, but simply about functioning exactly as well as we already are and understanding that this is enough for both general happiness and great achievements. 
- Third, regarding frustraation for not have time. We live in a time with endless possibilities around us, and this seems to have created the notion that life must be lived instensely. We try to exceed on all arenas at the same time, and one's self-confidience ends up on all what we do, instead of placing focus on one thing and doing this really, really well. Our focus shatters into a thousand little must-dos and must—haves, and time is somehow eaten up. But the principle is quite simple: The more possibilities, the more these is to refrain from. Today is no longer about prioritizing but about prioritizing away. Imaging yourself sitting at your desk in the morning and making a must-to-do list. Now challenge yourself and make a not-to-do list, and your brain will automatically shift in focus. Also, it's funny, despite our unique ability to think long-term, we want immediate response on our efforts. Posting a picture on social mdeiam for instance, We live our life with short-term focus, and we are losing the ability to build our own self-esteem, without constant feedback from others. So, how do we find a long-term focus, that focus that moves your life in the right direction? Achieving long-term focus requires that we learn to direct our attention inwards. To that what I call our inner core. To that which doesn't; need to a constant response. Because it's here, and perhaps only here, that we find geenuine contentment and satisfaction with who we are. 

So, why is all this so important to us all? Foucus is important because several essential abilities are linked to this innate skill. The ability to listen, to learn, to empathise, anf no at least, to steer our self and our life in the right direction. And as  the pace in our society will increase even more, it will require quiet a lot to navigate in this new unpredictable era, with a constantly growing roar around us. And do you know what? We must control the intense society. The intense society must not control us. And for this, we need to stay sharp and focused. But do you know what I'm worried about? I am concerned that our ability to steer our focus with our own power is something we are about to lose. I'm worried that we, in the future, will see two groups of people: those with the ability to co-exit and handle the intense society, and those who will become more or less slaves under the same possibiliies. 

Focus, this vitual force, is what brings out the best in ourselves and in others, something our world so greatly deserves. Now, finally, embrace the ability you have within yourself to be able to see the value of a small autumn leaf paluing in the mind.

### How to optimize your life?

We waste a lot of time. Life is like a messy jigsaw(拼图) with too much room between the cracks. There are the moments you're actually getting things done. And this? This is wasted time. Which, for the average person, amounts to 21.8 hours every week. That's equals to a part time job or running five whole marathons. The good news is we now have an arraty of good and servives designed to optimize out lives and squeeze that puzzle into an impermeable, airtight hunk of productivity. And all it takes if five pretty steps.

- Step one, minimize friction, maximize hustle. Imagine you wake up in the morning. Maybe in real life, you look like this, or this, or this. But right now, you're just going to look like this guy. You're 5'10'', average build, with a strong preference for citrus,  and an estimated lifespan of 82. Optimizing is going to allow you to milk as much time out of those 82 years as humanly possible. So pack your gym bag the night before. That way, you can grab it on your way out the door without having to think twice or second guess your athletic goals. Read your daily news briefing on the way to the gym and try to complete a seven minute, high intensity workout session, which can improve your oxygen consumption by up to 9%, allowing you to be more productive the rest of the day. Optiomization is about thinking on step ahead. If you order your coffee while you're still at the gym, you can pick it up on your way to work practicelly without having to stop. Seamless. Now you work for a while. In 1930, John Maynard Keynes famously predicted that, with the advance of technology, we would only have to work 15 hours a week to get by.  Well, Keynes' prediction was completely backward. Rather than reducing the hours we work, we've found a way to increase the work we do every hour. Eventually, you leave work and walk for a bit to offset the sitting. But then you need to eat off at the walking. Meal subscription services are awesome for this. So you can have everything you need for dinner chopped and waiting for you by the time you're unpacked and repacked your gym bag. Read a book while you cook, but not the whole book. These are services now that actually just give you the short version of the book. Same info, way less time. With all these time saving devices, you're now able to go to bed way ahead of schedule. And with polyphasic sleeping,  you can stop spending so much damn time unconscious,  and therefore unproductive. 
- Step two, iterate. The next morning, you're five hours ahead of time and feeling great. But you know you could be feeling better. At the gym, check your emails on the bike while drinking a meal replacement shake with an added shot of MCT oil to stabilize the glucose in your bloodstream and prevent you from getting hungry until dinner or maybe ever again. You're saving time and feeling great. And when you save time and feel great, you're going to have more time and energy to plan out how to save more time and feel even better. You're home wildly ahead of schedule and meal prepping next week's morning shakes. While Alexa reads off your 23 and Me result. In your dreams, you descend into a deep, fiery cave that looks kind of like your gym, except inside a volcano, visited by conjurings of all the people doing more than you. Victor something, who you haven't talked to since high school, but apparently has a tech startup and a six pack. 
- Wake up in a cold sweat ready to take your day to the next level with step three. Which is to ship step three. 
- Step four, accelerate. Fast forward a month. You have optimized your life so efficiently that you're now able to live five while days in the time takes most people to live just one. With a quick calculation, you realize that you previously predicted 82 year lifespan, combined with your current rate of productivety, minus the 34 years you lived before you learned how to optimize actually comes out to a whooping 240 productive years of life for you. 
- Step five, eventually, you die. You win the international award for most lives lived in one life. No one knows quite what it was you did with all that time. All they know is your sure didn't waste it, right?

### How does the stock run?

In the 1600s, the Dutch East India Company employed hundreds of ships to trade gold, porcelain, spices and silks around the globe.
But running this massive operation wasn't cheap. In order to fund their expensive voyages, the company turned to private citizens-
individuals who could invest money to support the trip in exchange for a share of the ship's profits. 
This practice allowed the company to afford even grander voyages, increasing profits for both themselves and their savvy investors.
Selling these shares in coffee houses and shipping ports across the continent,
the Dutch East India Company unknowingly invented the world's first stock market.
Since then, companies have been collecting funds from willing investors to support all kinds of business.
And today, the stock market has schools, careers, and even whole television channels dedicated to understanding it.

But the modern stock market is significantly more complicated 
than its original incarnation. So how do companies and investors use the market today?
Let's imagine a new coffee company that decides to launch on the market. 
First, the company will advertise itself to big investors. If they think the company is a good idea,
they get the first crack at investing and then sponsor the company's initial public offering, or IPO.
This launches the company onto the official public market, where any company or individual who believes 
the business could be profitable might by stock. Buying stocks makes those investors partial owners in the business.
Their investment helps the company to grow, and it becomes more successful, more buyers may see potential and start buying stocks.
As demand for those stocks increases, so does their price, increasing the cost for prospective buyers, 
and raising the value of the company's stocks people already own. 
For the company, this increased interest helps fund new initiatives, and also boosts its overall market value,
by showing how many people are willing to invest in their idea. However, if for some reason a company starts to seem less profitable, 
the reverse can also happen. If investors think their stock value is going to decline, 
they'll sell their stocks with the hopes of making a profit before the company loses more value.
As stocks are sold and demand for the stock goes down, the stocks price falls, 
and with it, the company's market value. 

These can leave investors with big losses - unless the company starts to look profitable again.
this see-saw of supply and demand is influenced by many factors. Companies are under the unavoidable influence of market forces
such as the fluctuating price of materials, changes in production technology, and the shifting costs of labor. 
Investors may be worried about changes in leadership, bad publicity, or larger factors like new laws and trade policies.
And of course, plenty of investors are simply ready to sell valuable stocks and pursue personal interests.
All these variables cause day-to-day noise in the marker, which can make companies appear more or less successful. 
And-in the stock market, appearing to lose value often leads to losing investors, and in turn, losing actual value.
Human confidence in the market has the power to trigger everything from economic booms to financial crises.
And this difficult-to-track variable is why most professional promote reliable long term investing over trying to make
quick cash.  

However, experts are constantly building tools in efforts increase their chances of success in this highly unpredictable system.
But the stock market is not just for the rich and powerful. With the dawn of the Internet, everyday investors can buy stocks 
in many of the exact same ways a large investor would. And as more people educate themselves about this complex system.
they too can trade stocks, support the businesses they believe in, and pursue their financial goals. 
The first step is getting invested.

### Why did you struggled with making meaningful progress towards your goals?

Let's start with a story about this YouTube channel. 
In October of 2016, I posted my first YouTube video, I didn't show my face, used the pseudonym rather than my real name,
and I didn't feel all that comfortable actually doing it. After all, I used to be somewhat anti-social media and very private.
Regardless, I committed to a schedule and I stuck to it.
Every Saturday at 8AM, I would post a new video no matter what. 
A few weeks later, I brought new animation software, didn't know how to use it, 
and found myself staying up all Friday night and into Saturday until 7AM.
before I got the video finished and uploaded. I wasn't gonna ship an upload, no matter what, 
while growing my channel was always a goal, it's difficult to realistically assign a number to,
something that is so arbitrary as subscriber count. So I didn't. I just focus on my commitment.
Week after week, month after month, I posted a new video.
Five months later, in March of 2017, we hit 100000 subscribers.
By month 11, in September of 2017, we hit 200000. Fast forward to 2018, and it became much more than just a YouTube channel
and evolved into a full-fledged business and my main source of income.
Now, imagine if I took a more traditional approach to goal setting.
Let's say hitting 100000 subscribers in 5 months wasn't a coincidence but
actually my goal from the start. I'd start off excited and hopeful but at month four,
I'd likely be discouraged that I still had fewer than 30000 subscribers.
In fact, I may give up at that point, or at least be less disciplined with my weekly schedule.
I could have missed the opportunity of continuing to post and having a sleep video go viral that would add over.
60000 subscribers in just one month. It was non-linear growth and there was no way for me to see it coming.
When setting goals, most of us think of a specific desired outcome, set an arbitrary time frame, and hope for the best.

I wanna get to 10% body fat before summer. I wanna make 100000 before the end of the year.
Then we think of the steps required to get there, and lazily half-reverse engineer the plan of attack.
Best case scenario, we don't reach our goals. Worst case scenario, the goal and timeline act as perverse incentives.
with unintended negative effects. By rushing to lose body fat before summer, you may resort to unhealthy weight loss pills or other radical means
that my come with long term health tradeoffs. By rushing to make 100000 above all else, you may compromise in your morals,
bend the rules and end up in legal trouble, or sacrifice long term sustainable growth for a quick buck that burns hot hut dies fast.
Instead of focusing on a concrete end goal, focus your attention and energy on the habits, practises and routines that will 
facilitate your desired outcomes. There aren't shortcuts in life. Just those that are willing to put in the work, consistently, 
and those who aren't. Rather than 10% body fat by summertime, aim to life weights 5 times per week, eat at a 500 calorie deficit, and do 2 days of HIIT.
Whether you hit 10% body fat by summertime isn't all that important.

You've now set the foundation for a healthy habit that's going to give you a killer physique long term,
whether this summer or next. Rather than prioritizing a 100000 before the end of the year, focus on putting in 10 hours every week into your side hustle.
Focus on marketing, revenue generation, and recruitment and see where you end up in 12 months time.
Best case, you'll build a respectable brand that grows and exceeds your expectations.
Worst case, you'll learn business fundamentals that will position you well for your next entrepreneurial endeavor. 
This approach has a few distinct advantages. 

First, this maximizes the odds that you actually achieve your desired level of success.
After all, successful people don't get there by relying on temporary bursts of motivation and inspiration.
They get there by consistently showing up, day after day, regardless of how they feel and putting in the work.


Second, even if you fail in achieving your goals, chances are you'll have made significant process and learned something meaningful along the way.
After you have your scheduled practice in place, make sure you set up a system to track your progress. Tracking your process has two main
benefits. First, tracking serves as a method of feedback. You instantly gain greater clarity of what is and is not working.
You'll be better equipped in knowing when to keep pushing, and when to change gears and course correct. Second, tracking functions as a motivator.
Seeing previous progress, even if it's slow but steady, can often be the difference between you sticking to your commitment for the day and falling through.
Weight training is a scheduled habit that is important in facilitating the outcomes I desire. 

I use two method to track the habit.
- I use the app Strides on my phone to mark the completion of certain habits, I input five days per week of lifting as my target,
and this app helps to keep me accountable.
- I track workouts on a custom Google Sheets template that I created. During every workout, I update the spreadsheet, with the number
of sets and reps of each exercise. Including the RPE, a measurement of how difficult the set was.
By tracking these variables, I'm better able to course correct and optimally program my upcoming workouts.
This isn't something you should be doing daily, as emotional swings may convince you to quit or compromise on your goals.
Rather, your reviews should occur every 1-3 months in most cases. For you study strategies, are you satisfied with your grades?
Are you practicing evidence-based study strategies and staying focused when you should be?

Have you listened to constructive criticism and feedback from your audience? I found the habit of journaling helpful when it comes to reflection and review.
By writing down your thoughts, rather than simply thinking them. they are solidified with greater clarity. Be clear about what you are going to continue doing.
and what methods or systems you'll experiment with changing. This is key. Fear is an insidious that can color our perceptions and hijack our plans.
This practice, whereby you explicitly write out your fears, the ways to prevent them and how to repair them, is a tremendously useful exercise in keeping
your fears in check.


### Slow your time

If you are luck enough to decide to pace that you want to travel through your life, it's a privilege.

You might decide that you need both to speed up and to create slow time, time to reflect, to percolate at your own pace.

### How to declutter your mind

I believe we are responsible for creating the moments of joy in our own life.

We can't take credit for a beautiful sunrise, but we can take credit for being there to see it.

That's why I am very excited to be here today to share some of what I've learned with you.

What people have the capacity to choose they have ability to change. 

Declutter your mind by creating a mental inventory. Get rid of the things that don't matter.

Focus on things that interest you by designing small actionable projects.

Get into a daily habit of updating your mental inventory.

The intentional life has the power to grant you more of those beautiful moments in the sun.


### How to move through insecurities

I've always believed that to feel really good about ourselves it's important as I call it to be lit up in life.

I moved through insecurities and tapped into that passion and purpose.

All to search for life meaning, I was lonely.

If you were able to acknowledge those negative thoughts and let them go, and then turn the volume 
and the noise down.

What would you open up for you and what would be possible? Unlimited possible, no speed limit.

I encourage you to take time out every day for self-reflection. 


### How do we break free of our habitual negative bias of our brain towards stressful state?

Generally, stress refers to tension, but angry, fear, hurt, loneliness, frustration are all stressful state.

Beautiful state is a state of connection, joy, love, compassion, vitality and passion.

If you are not a beautiful state, your default state is stress.

If you look at the entirety of human life, behind war or peace, cooperation or corrosive politics,
love or separation, persistence or failure behind all these is the driving force of these two states.

In a beautiful state, there is no compulsive illumination f the past or anxiety over the future.

It's a state where experience inner simplicity and a brilliance of an uncluttered mind.

Realizing that all lingering and suffering is a total preoccupation with oneself. That's an obsessive self-centric thinking, is the
most powerful antidote.

Paying more attention to yourself leads to disconnection from others and always tangles the past or fears the future,
which is the source of stress. Focus more on other things and experience the feelings of others that needed.

### We all see the world through our mind's eyes.

But if you asked the person on your left, they might have said regret and skepticism, and if you asked
somebody on your right, they might have said somethings entirely different, like hope or empathy.

Perception is subjective. What we think we see is actually filtered through our own mind's eye.

So to begin to track this questions, my research team and I decide to delve deeply into an issue that have received international attention:
our health and fit.

Across the world, people are struggling to manage their weight and their is a variety of strategies.

Keeping your eyes on the price, made the exercise look and feel easier, even when people were working hard because they were moving faster.

We all see the world through our own mind's eye, but we can teach ourselves to see it differently.

In some days, It might look like the world is a dangerous and challenging and insurmountable place, but It does't 
have to look that way all the time. We can teach ourselves to see it differently, and when we find a way to make the world look nice and easier.

### Objectives and Key Results

We are at a critical moment, our leader and some instruction haven't taken us to the wrong objectives.

How are we going to choose the right course?

They set meaningful and audacious goals, the right goals for the right reasons.

It almost doesn't matter what you know, execution is what matters the most.

Objectives and Key Results, or OKRs, are a simple goal-setting system and they work for organizations, they work for teams,
they even work for individuals.

The objectives are what you want to have accomplished. The key results are how I'm going to get the done.

A lot of organizations set objectives and meet them, they ship their sales, they introduce their new products, they make their numbers.
but they lack a sense of purpose to inspire their teams. 

OKRs cultivate the madness, and magic is right around the corner. That is perfect.

A good results are specific and time-bound. They are aggressive but realistic. They are measurable, and they're verifiable.

These are not used for bonuses or for promotions. They used for the high purpose and that's go to the collective commitment to truly stretch goals.

OKRs are not a sliver bullet. They're not going to be a substitute for a strong culture or for strong leadership, but when those fundamentals are 
in place, they can take you to the mountaintop.

Let's fight for what it is that really matters, because we can take OKRs beyond our business. We can take them to our families, to our schools, even to our governments.

We can transform those information. We can back to the right track, if we can and do measure what really matters. 

### The hidden power of smile

When I was a child, I always wanted to be a superhero. I wanted to save the world and make everyone happy.

I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science, to find a more useful truth.

The researchers found that the span of a player's smile could actually predict the span of his life.

Smiling is one of the most basic, biologically uniform expressions of all humans.

We smile often, and use smiles to express joy and satisfaction.

Outside of this room, more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day, whereas less than 14 percent of us smile.

By showing that facial feedback, modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain, in a way that helps us feel better when we smile.

Smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate, a well-regarded pleasure inducer can not match.

When you smile, you don't only appear to be more likable and courteous, but you actually appear to be more competent.

So whenever you want to look great and competent, reduce your stress, or improve your marriage, 
that will help you and everyone around you live a longer, healthier, happier life, smile.  


### How disease spread all around the world?

We live in an interconnected, an increasingly globalized world. Thanks international jet travel, people and the disease they carry
can be in any city on the planet in a matter of hours.

And once a virus touches down, sometimes all it takes is one sneeze to speed the infection throughout the community.

When humans were hunter-gatherers, roaming the wild savannas, we were never in one place long enough, and settlement were 
not large enough to sustain the transmission of infectious microbes.

In the Middle East, people began living side-by-side animals, facilitating the spread of bacteria and viruses between cattle and humans.

But the most common cause of epidemics are viruses, such as measles, influenza and HIV. And we they go global, we call them pandemics.

The first indication of the pandemic came in Spring, when American troops in northern France began complaining of chills, headaches and fever.

He was harboring a new animal-origin virus called SARS, short for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.

SARS was a reminder that pandemics have always been associated with panic.

If history teaches us anything, it's that while pandemics may start small, their impacts can be as dramatic
as wars and natural disasters.

The different today is that science gives us the ability to detect pandemics right at the very beginning 
and to take action to mitigate their impacts before they spread too widely.


### The way to overcome FOBO

You're probably familiar with FOMO, that's short of "Fear Of Missing Out".

Everyone do something better than what you are doing now.

It's far more dangerous, it's called FOBO, and it's short for "Fear Of a Better Option".

We live in a world of overwhelming choice, even the decisions that used to be simple, like choosing a restaurant or making everyday purchases are 
fraught with over analysis.

Technology has only made the issue more pronounced.

Chances are you've experienced FOBO when you struggled to choose just one from a group of perfectly acceptable outcomes.

It's a symptom of a culture which sees value in collecting and preserving as many options as possible.

Shouldn't it be a privilege to have so many good options to choose from.

The problem is, FOBO induces such server analysis paralysis that it can negatively impact both personal and professional life.

When you can't make a decisions with conviction, you waste precious and energy.

With any decision you make, you first have to determine the stakes as this will inform your
decision-making strategy.

You only really face three types of decisions in life: high stakes, low stakes and no stakes.

Something is in required but these aren't make-or-break deliberations and you probably forget about them in a few weeks.

The FOBO comes when you struggle to choose just one from a group of perfectly acceptable options.

So no matter what you choose, you can rest assured that the downside is limited.

You have plentiful opportunities to live decisively, you may not get everything you want, but the mere fact you get to decide is powerful.


### How to make a career change?

In the last 15 years of my career, I've been an English teacher, attorney, video game creator and now a 
toilet paper salesman, selling millions of rolls of toilet paper a year.

I then came upon the epiphany that takes years if not tens of thousands of hours to get really good at something.
I really didn't have a lot of time to waste.

First, the there things to think about before you're ready to move on:
- Professional life is about learning.
- Career changes are often gut-driven.
- Pain shouldn't be a factor.

You're convinced that it's time to change your career:
- Go out the network and meet new people.
- Shore up your finances.
- Learn to side hustles.

If you're ready made the move, the three things you should think about doing:
- Do not burn bridges.
- Take stock what you've learned.
- Don't worry, take a deep breath.


### How to improve the 

A few years ago, my obsession with productivity got so bad that I suffered 
an episode of burnout that scared the hell out of me.

I'm talking insomnia, wight gain, hair loss - the works, I was so overworked.
that my brain literally couldn't come up with another idea.

That indicated to me that my identity was linked with this idea of productivity.

Do you feel guilty if you haven't been productive enough during the day? Do you spend hours reading productivity hacks, trying
new frameworks and testing new apps to get even more done?
I've tried them all things that are meant to manage your day.

We've been so obsessed with doing more that we've missing the most important thing.

Historically, productivity as we know it today was used during the industrial revolution. It was a system that measured performance
based on consistent output.

When we shifted to a knowledge economy, people suddenly had tasks that were more abstract things
like writing, problem-solving or strategizing, tasks that weren't easy to measure.

Companies struggled to figure out how to tell who was working and who wasn't, so they just adopted
the old systems as best as they could, leading to the things like the dreaded time sheet, where everyone is under pressure.
to justify how they spend every second of their day. These systems don't make a lot of sense for creative work.

We still think of productivity as an endurance sport. You try to churn out as many blog posts or we cram our day full of meetings. 
But this model of constant output isn't conducive to creative thought.

Today, knowledge workers are facing a big challenge. We're expected to be constantly producing and creative is equal measure.
But our brains to continuously generate new ideas with no rest. In fact, downtime is a necessity for our brain to recovery and to operate properly.

Let our minds wander is an essential mental state that helps us develop our identity.
process social interactions and even influences our internal moral compass.

Our need for a break flies in the face of our cultural narrative about hustling.
In other words, the stories that we as a society tell each other about what success looks like and what 
it takes to get there.

Everyone has their own narratives that they have to uncover, It wasn't until I started digging around my own beliefs around the work
that I began to unravel the root of my own work story, finally being able to let go of destructive behaviors.
and make positive, long-lasting changes.

And the only way to do that is by asking yourself some hard questions. Does being busy make you feel valuable?
Who do you hold up as an example of success? Where did your ideas of work ethic come from? How much of how you are and is linked to
what you do?

You creativity, it has its own rhythms, our energy fluctuates daily, even seasonally. 

- Dismantling myths
- Challenging your old views


###

We do have a problem thought, and that is the most important relationship we have in our lives
is one we have with ourselves and we are not taught about it.

I want to challenge you to think about if we were taught how to look after ourselves using self-care.
could we help enrich our lives, make us happier, combat our insecurities and enable us to reach our full potential?

Body image is often associated with teenage girls.
Eating disorders and mental health can affect anyone at any age, at any time.


So I decided to use those experiences that i've had to gain a better understanding of the relationship.
I have with my body and myself. And by practicing self-care, I was able to change my life. If you haven't already started, to start the journal of self-love.

It's crazy these days, we have so many pressures, and now we have social media, with the rise of social media, 
we literaly have a weapon of mass destruction to our self-esteem 24/7.

Social media is a curated, filtered, often airbrushed and sometimes even lifestyle illusion.
That's why we need to be taught about it how to cope with these pressures in schools. We need to 
taught how to look after ourselves mentally, physically and emotionally.

The main concept we teach is the "beauty ideal myth", we get all of kids to have magazines and pick up the 
perfect body. It's so detrimental to your mental and physical health. 

I'm so grateful I've been here today and able to connect with you all, because I want to encourage every single one of you
to invest in yourself right now. I want to you understand that if you learn self-care, practice self-care, you can get the gift
self-care. Imaging being able to give your loved ones, the gift of self-love. Speaking to your body in a loving way. It's the only
one you've got. It's your home and it deserves your respect. If you see anyone tearing themselves down, build them back up.
And watch your life positively grow, when you give up the pursuit of perfection. Because the real beauty ideal is being imperfectly you
Thank you so much, everybody.


### The six steps to improve your emotional intelligence ?

I want to start with doing a small survey with you. For that, please puts your hands into your laps and close your eye.

I want to be honest with you, emotional intelligence is not necessarily my main strength. When I make decisions, I based 
them solely on my rational.

Five years ago, when I dropped out of a job because of a burnout. It was then that my very emotional side was 
revealed, and while I rarely cried before, especially not in front of people, I just couldn't stop the tears from 
streaming down my face at the most inconvenient of times anymore.

It has a bad connotation, describing a person having or expressing strong feelings. It's describing a person having and 
expressing strong feeling.

It's the ability to identify and manage your emotions and those of others, and it's set to include three skills:
- emotional awareness: empathy, empathy towards others but also towards the self
- the ability to harness motions and apply them to tasks like problem solving
- the ability to manage emotions, which includes regulating your own emotions and cheering up
or calming down other people

We first of all need to consider emotional intelligence as a curial skill in our society, and then
also take the time to consciously work on it.

I tried to compile my experiences and came up with six-step guide that hopefully helps people to get more emotional intelligence.
- Acknowledge Emotions 
- Differentiate and Analysis Emotions
- Accept and Appreciate Emotions
- Reflect on your Emotions and Their Origin
- Handle your emotions
- Handle the emotions of others


### What causes recessions?

For millennia, the people of Britain had been using bronze to make tools and jewelry and as a currency for trade.
But around 800 BCE, the began to change: the value of bronze declined, causing social upheaval and an economic crisis
what we would call a recession today.

This question has long been a subject of heated debate among economists, and for good reason.
A recession can be a mild decline in economic activity in single country that lasts months, a
long-lasting downturn with global ramifications that last years, or anything in between.

There're countless variables that contribute to an economic's health, making it difficult to 
pinpoint specific causes.

Recession occur when there is a negative disruption to the balance between supply and demand.
There's a mismatch between how goods people want to buy, how many products and services products can offer,
and prices of goods and services sold, which prompts an economic decline.

An economy's relationship between supply and demand is reflected in its inflation rates and interest rates.
Inflation happens when goods and services get more expensive. Put another way, the value of money decreases.
Still, inflation isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, a low inflation rate is thought to encourage economic
activity. But high inflation that isn't accompanied with high demand can both cause problems for economic and eventually
lead to recession.

Interest rate, meanwhile, reflect the cost of taking on debt for individuals and companies. The rate is typically
an annual percentage of a loan that borrowers pay to their creditors until the loan is rapid.
Low interest rates mean that companies can afford to borrow more money, which they can used to invest in more
projects. High interest rates, meanwhile, increase rates for producers and consumers, slowing the economic activity.

Fluctuations in inflation and interest rates can give us insight into the health of economy, but what causes these fluctuations
in the first place?
- The most obvious causes are shocks like natural disaster, war and geopolitical factors.
An earthquake can destroy the infrastructure needed to produce important commodities such as oil.

- Some recessions occur in times of economic prosperity, possible even because of economic prosperity.
The business activity can occasionally reach an unsustainable level, corporations and consumers may borrow
more money with the assumption that economic growth will help them handle the added burden. But if the 
economic doesn't grow as quickly as expected, they may end up with more debt than they can manage.
To pay it off, they'll have to redirect funds from other activities, reducing business activity.

- Psychology can also contribute to a recessions. Fear of a recessions can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
if it causes people to pull back investing and spending. In response, producers might cut operating costs to help
weather the expected delcine in demand. That can lead to a vicious cycle as cost cuts eventually lower wages.
leading to even lower demand.

- Even policy designed to help prevent recessions can contribute. When times are though, governments and central banks may
print money, increase spending, and lower central bank interest rates. Smaller lenders can in turn lower their interests rates,
effectively making debt "cheaper" to boost spending. But these policies are not sustainable and eventually need to be reversed.
These cause a recession if people have become too reliant on cheap debt and government stimulus.

Each recession provides new data to help anticipate and response to future recessions more effectively.

### What happen if you get infected with the coronavirus?

As of the morning of February 27，2020， there were at least 82000 confirmed cases worldwide of the coronavirus and 
2810 deaths from it.

There are certain people who get infected and have very serious illness among them are health workers.
It's a very serious inflection in them as they get a higher does than normal people. At the same time, they have no immunity.
So in general population, it's likely that does of virus that you receive with you are infected is much less
than the does that a health worker would receive. Health worker having more serious infections.
So that leaves the elderly and those with comorbidities to really be the ones that we have to make sure.
are taken care of in hospitals. 

The most concerned are people, who are, first of all, in developing countries, and who don't have access to good medical care
and may not have access at all to a hospital, should an epidemic occur in their country.

First of all, pulmonary disease exciting as a comorbidity is also important. in general, the elderly are at greater risk.
especially those over 70, because their immune systems are not as effective as they might have once been and they are more 
susceptible to inflections.

It's our responsibility to get the information as individuals, so we understand, and make sure that we can contribute in our own way.
to prevention of major spread.

This is an infection that's coming to humans who have never been exposed to this virus before. They don't have any antibody protections.
and it's not clear whether their immune system can handle this virus or not. This is a virus that usually finds itself in bats or in other 
animals, and all of a sudden, it's in humans. Humans just don't have experiences with this virus.

It's clearly understand that airports or any land borders cannot prevent a disease from entering. 
People in the incubation period can cross the border can enter countries and can then infect others when they become sick.
So borders are not a means of preventing infections from entering a country by checking temperatures. 

Vaccines are under development right now, there's a lot of research going on. That research requires first that the vaccine be developed.
then that it be studied for safety and effectiveness in animals, who are challenged with the virus after they are vaccinated,
and then it must go into human studies.

We will eventually have more and more of these outbreaks. So an emerging inflection today is just a warning.
of what will happen in the future. We have to make sure that technical collaboration in the world is their to work together to make 
sure that we can understand these outbreaks when they occur and rapidly provide the information necessary to control them.

### What is beauty?

Galton is a brilliant polymath. He's an explorer, an anthropologist, a sociologist, a psychologist and a statistician.
He presents a new technique by which he can combine photographs and produce composite portraits.
This technology could be used to characterize different types of people. If he combines photographs of violent criminals,
he will discover the face of criminality.

- The composite or average faces are typically more attractive than each individual face that contributes to the average.
has been replicated many times.

- The second factor that contributes to beauty is symmetry. People generally find symmetric faces more attractive than asymmetric ones.

- The third factor that contributes to facial attractiveness is the effect of hormones.
Men typically find women attractive who have elements of both youth and maturity.

Attractive faces activate parts of our visual cortex in the back of brain, an area called the fusiform gyrus, that is especially tuned 
to processing faces, and an adjacent area called the lateral occipital complex, that is especially attuned to processing objects.
In addition, attractive faces activate parts of our reward and pleasure centers in the front and deep in the brain and these 
include areas that have complicated names, like the ventral striatum, the orbitofrontal cortex and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

Our visual brain that is tuned to processing faces, interacts with our pleasure centers to underpin the experiences of beauty.
Amazingly, when we all engage with beauty, without our knowledge, beauty also engages us.
Our brains respond to attractive faces, even when we're not thinking about beauty.
Taken together, these studies suggest that our brain automatically responds to beauty by linking vision and pleasure.
Our brains seem to reflexively associate beauty and good. And this reflexive association may be the biologic trigger for many
social effects of beauty.

Attractiveness people receive all kinds of advantages in life. They're regards as intelligent, more trustworthy, they'r given
higher pay and lesser punishments, even when such judgements are not warranted. Unfortunately, we also have a "disfigured is bad" stereotype.

Beauty is a work in process. The so-called universal attributes of beauty were selected for during almost two millions years
of the Pleistocene. Life was nasty, brutish and a very long time age. The selection criteria for reproductive success from that time, don't 
really apply today. And under this relaxed conditions, preferences and trait combinations are free to drift and become more variable.
Even as we are profoundly affecting our environment, modern medicine and technological innovation is profoundly affecting 
the very essence of what it means to look beautiful. The universal nature of beauty is changing, even as we changing the universe.


### How some kids get tracked towards college and others towards detention?

My first job out of college was an academic researcher at one of the largest juvenile detention centers in the country.
And everyday I would drive to this building on the West Side of Chicago, go through the security checkpoint and walk down
these brown, brick hallways as I made my way down to the basement to observe the intake process.

And as I set there on the side of glasses from them, idealistic with a college degree, I wondered to my self: Why didn't schools
do something more to prevent this from happening?

I've learned that so much of this problem is systemic that often our school system perpetuates the social divide. It make worse
what it's supported to fix. That's as crazy or controversial as saying that our health care system isn't preventative.
but somehow profits off of keeping us sick.

If we are serious about helping more kids from across the board to achieve and make it in this world, we are going to have to realized that 
our gaps in student outcomes are not so much about achievements as much as they are opportunity.

Lower resource schools are dealing with lower quality equipment, obsolete technology and paying teachers way less.

But for who knows how long authorities have turned a blind eye to those who can bribe their way onto the most elite and beautiful
college campuses. A public education system should not create a wider bottom and more narrow top.
Some of us can sometimes think that these things aren't that close to home, but they are if we broaden our view, because a leaky
faucet in our kitchen, broken radiator in our hallway those part of our house that we always say we're going to get to next week.
they're devaluing our whole property. Why don't we try to reclaim the promise of public education and remember that it's our greatest
collective responsibility?

And sometime for the student, innovation is just daring to implement common sense. I recently researched these partnerships being built
between high schools, community colleges and local businesses, who are creating internships in finance, health care and technology.
for students without "sliver spoon" connections to gain important skills and contribute to the communities that they come from.

It's not: Can school save more of our students? Because I think we have the answer to that and it's yes they can, if we save our school first.
We can start by caring about the education of others people's children. Cultivating as much talent as possible, getting as many girls as we
can from all over into science and engineering, as many boys as we can into teaching those are investments for our future.

Our students are like our most valuable resources, and when you put it that way, our teachers are like our modern-day diamond and gold miners,
hoping to help make them shine. Let's contribute our voices, our votes and our support to giving them the resources that they will need not just to survive.
but hopefully thrive, allowing all of us to do so as well.


### fan girl

Four years ago, a teenage girls changed my life in one conversation. She casually told me that she had met the man she was going to marry.
And she told me that his name is Harry Styles. And that was the moment that I became obsessed with fangirls
I didn't know it them but that moment would transform the course of my life and go on to change everything that I thought I knew and being a adult.

A fangirl is a 'girl' or woman who is an extremely or overly enthusiastic fan of someone or something.
Technically, you can have fangirls of anything, but my specific interest was in fangirls of boy bands.
Because of their somewhat lethal(致命的) reputation(名气). 

Harry Styles was a member of One Direction. Harry Styles was reputed for his compassionate demeanor and perfect hair.
I learn this when I read thousand of tweets about him. I learn that he is a sweet cupcake. L learn that he was a perfect angle.

I read hours of fan fiction and I fall down this specific rabbit hole of stories that actually place me as protagonist inside of various
imagined romances with him. So in one, I tell him that I'm pregnant with his child. In another, we meat in hospital where we're both fighting cancer.
And in another, we fall so deeply in love that we become fugitives who kill people. 

But then, something unthinkable happens, One directions, the biggest boy band on the planet, loses a member. Zayn Malik quits the band,
and the internet explodes with feels. I read tweets as these girls describe the physical pain of this loss, how they can't eat or sleep or walk.
I read them describe how much Zayn had meat to them. And I watch videos of 10-year-old girls crying.
Then I watch as mainstream news outlets cover the story. I read them describe these 'young banshees'. I read one journalist say: It's commonly known 
fact since the age of Beatles that there is nothing scarier in this world than a group of excited teenage girls.

Then I asked myself a questions I've never consider in my life. Why is it that the image of young girls screaming their lungs out with excitement for a pop star
is considered crazy, psycho, scary, a bit much? But the image of young boys screaming their lungs out for a footballer is perfectly normal?
As soon as I realized this double standard, I realized that all of my curiosity about fangirls has been sparked by exactly the same judgements.
I, too, has suspected that they were a bit crazy. I'd looked at images of girls screaming for the Beatles and the world had come to mind was not "excitement", was hysteria.
Hysteria was considered to be a legitimate female mental disorder that could be diagnosed by doctors if women displayed excessive emotion or difficult behavior.

I decide to redeclare my obsession. Because I am no longer just obsessed with fangirls. Now I'am obsessed with the way that the world talks about fangirls.
and the way the world looks at young, female enthusiasm. I want to know, if girls grow up in a world where words like 'crazy', 'psycho', and 'hysterical' are casually used to describe 
female enthusiasm, then how does that shape the way that those girls get to see themselves? And if girls grow up in a world that tells them
that they are designed just a bit crazier than the boys, then it's that a little bit like telling them that they are born less
capable of rationality than men, less capable of reason and unworthy of the same intellectual respect as their brothers.

What if we rethink the judgements we've been conditioned to feel when we see young women screaming their lungs out with excitement?
What if we decided to rethink the words we use to described that joy, and what if we didn't allow ourselves to diminish girls.
with words that undermine their intelligence, their interests and their capability?
You all just sounded stunning and as sane and as intelligent and as dignified as when you walked in this room.


### Signs you are wasting your life.

Life is precise and we only get one shot at it. Nevertheless, a lot of people spend their life, merely passing the time rather than making the most of the shot time they have left.
Young people are especially guilty of this -- we are springtime of our lives. If ever there was a time to plant a tree, it's now.
Yet most of us don't do that. Young people spend their time parting, eating junk food and taking vacations rather than reading, building new skill sets, building healthy habits and investing themselves.

Are you merely passing the time instead of making the most of your life? Here are some ways to tell.
- You don't get out of bed quickly upon waking. 
People who have a driving purpose in their life don't spend time lounging around on their phone in bed.
Waking up is no big deal, just start of another random day. To someone with a purpose, waking up every morning is a refreshing welcome to another day of hard yet meaningful work.

- You spend more than one hour or two a day on aimless activities. Some activities are inherently aimless, done only because they are pleasing in the moment. 
Some activities like this are: Spending time on social media, watching TV or movie and playing video games.
These kind of activities can be an important part of decompressing. Anymore than that, though, and you are going beyond 'decompressing' into 'wasting your life'.
People with a purpose don't spend too long doing these sorts of things, because they are aware that every hour sucked away by aimless activities.
The sought of wasting that much of time make them sick.

- You don't feel ready for deb at the end of each day. People whose days are filled with purposeful activities. 
feel tired at the end of the day. Whether it's mental work or physical work, purposeful activity uses up all of your energy
and leaves of you ready to go to bed each day. When you aren't making the most of your life, on the other hand, you're not tired 
at the end of the day. You are, quite literally, not making the most of your energy.

- You spend more of your time planning than doing. If you spend more of your time daydreaming, planning or thinking about the future,
that you do working to bring about that future. You are not making the most of your life. People who make something of themselves, pick
a goal for the future and then work hard to make that goal happen.

- You worry what others think of you. High achievers are too busy getting things done to worry others think of them. High achievers 
may worry about what people who matter think of them, but they don't worry about what their friends, family or pop culture thinks.
They are too busy getting things done. If you routinely worry about what your friends, family, peers or pop culture thinks of you,
you may be letting your life slip by.

Instead of doing what others approve of, finding a guide purpose that you can be true to even when world turns against you.


### This changed my view of death

I've been doing some thinking. I'm going to kill my dad. My dad has frontotemporal lobe dementia. It's a confusing disease that hits people 
in their 50s or 60s. It can completely change someone's personality, making them paranoid and even violent. My dad's been sick for a decade,
but three years ago he got really sick, and we had to move him out his house. The house that I grew up in, that house that he build with his 
own hands. My strapping, cool dad with the falsetoo singing voice had to move into a facility for round-the-clock care when he is just 65.

At first, my mom, my sister and I made a mistake of putting him in a regular nursing home. It was really pretty. It had plush carpet
and afternoon art classes and a Dog named Diane. But then I got a phone call. "Ms. Malone, we've arrested your father." "What?" "Well, he 
threatened everybody with cutlery. And then he yanked the curtains off the wall, and then he tried to throw plants out the window." And then 
,well, he pulled all the old ladies out of their wheelchairs." 

After when he kicked off their, we bounced him between a bunch of state-run facilities before finding a treatment center specifically 
for people with dementia. At first, he kind of liked it, but over time his health declined and one day I walked in and finding him sitting
hunched over on the ground wearing a onesie -- those kinds of outfits that zip in the back. I watched him for about an hour as he yanked at it,
trying to find a way out of this thing. And it's supported to be practical, but to me it looked like a straight jacket. And so I ran out. 
I left him there. I sat in my trunk, his old trunk, hunched over, this really deep guttural cry coming out of the pit of my belly.
I just couldn't believe that my father, the Adonis of my youth, my really dear friend, would think that this kind of life was worth living anymore.
We're programmed to prioritize productivity. So when a person is no longer productive in the way we expect him to be, the way that he expects himself to be. 
What dose that life have left? That day in the truck, all I could imagine was that my dad was being tortured and his body was vessel of that torture.
I've got to get him out of that body. 

The truth is we talk about his death a lot. When will it happen? What will it be like? But I wish that we would have talked about death when we
were health. What does my best death look like? Sometimes people hang on when they are worried about loved ones. Just tell them you're safe, and it's OK
when you're ready. And I memorized his hands, feeling so grateful that his spirit was still attached to his body. And In that moment, I realized I'm not
responsible for this person. I'm not his doctor and maybe the best way to help him and me is to resume our roles as father and daughter.  

### It's Time To Let Go Of Your Best Friend.

You are on-going help, sharing and liking has helped Psyh2go to continue our mission to make psychology accessible to everyone.

Are you lucky enough to have a best friend or at least have known a deep trusting friendship? Finding a true and loving friendship, the one makes you feel happy,
safe and security, is so rare and special that when we do, we can't help but wish that it would last forever. Having friends like this can be the greatest pleasures in life.
So it can be devastating for us to lose them. Saying "Good Bye" to a best friend is heart breaking. But trying to savage a friendship that's not meant to last, does more harm than good.

Loving someone means doing what's best for them, even when it hurts you. With that said, here are 6 Signs That Can Help You realized 
That It's Time To Let Go Of Your Best Friend.

- You are second guessing your friendship. Though you don't want to admin it, you are starting to second guessing the friendship. Questioning what the point
of the friendship is. You're both changed so much that almost as if you're completely different people now. You no longer have anything in common and don't know 
what to talk about. Conversions that were once easy going and fun, now feel constantly awkward and forced. 

- You don't communicate anymore. Another common reason why friendship end, is because people tend to grow apart over time. You and your best friend have both gone
on your separate ways, but you still holding on and pretending like you have it. You still see them as your best friend even if 
you haven't kept in touch talked to them in ages. You barely see each other anymore, and neither of you make any effect to get together.

- You want different things. We all have plans and goals that we want to achieve in our lives and sometimes pursuing them can mean to let certain people go. 
It's hard when you and your best friend want different, very different things for yourselves and staying in the friendships means sacrificing one or the other's hopes or dreams.
Asking someone to give that up for you will only make them resent you for it in the end. 

- You've found other friends. You may not realise that you and your best friend are already drifting apart, until you make new close friends. When being with people, other than your bestie
feels more compatible and comfortable, that already a clear sign that it's time to let go. Or at least accept that friendship isn't what it was and now the status of "BEST FRIEND" drop.
That doesn't mean the new friends will treat you better or that you like them more than your best friend.

- They've broken your trust. This is a particularly a sad reason for ending a friendship. Unfortunately, it does happen. Trust is, after all, the foundation of any health relationship.
Without it, things can never move forward or get between you and your best friends. Although repeated forgiveness and moving on is an option the best thing you can do at that point is to start
over and find peace with someone else.

- You're the only one holding on. Finally, if you that the effect to keep the friendship alive is virtually one sided with you being the load bearer, then it might to be time to end things with this
person. As much as it hurts to be rejected, especially by someone you've considered to be your closest and dearest friend. Trying to force 
them to change their mind is still wrong. If they don't want you in their life anymore, spare yourself the indignity and leave. Asking for answers and 
get closure is an option. Anymore than that thought is not recommended. 


Generally speaking, it's not good for your self-esteem and mental health to stay with someone who clearly doesn't want you.
No matter how you look at it, letting go of someone you love is the one of the most difficult and painful decisions you're ever going to 
make in life. You may experience a cycle of grieving with stages of anger, denial and sadness before accepting it. 

Some things are just meant to come apart and that's okay. People are meant to change and mature. Moving forward in life
means learning and growing from your past not being held back by it.    

### why you still single?

Do you feel everyone in your life is already in a relationship expect you? Do you find yourself wondering why you still haven't found that special someone?
despite being such a good catch. You may be attractive, successful, charming or financially well-off. However, you still struggle to settle down.
So what are the circumstances in your life that might be keeping you from finding the right person for you. Here are six probable reasons why you still single:

- You don't have a sense of identity, do you find it hard to find a partner or make your relationships last, it maybe because you don't really know yourself well enough.
If you still unsure of who you are or what you want in your life. It's will be hard to know what you want in your partner? Do you search for love as a way to fill the emptiness.
you feel inside of yourself mistakenly believing that being in a relationship will make you whole. The truth is you can be in a relationship and still feel lonely that emptiness
you're struggling with is likely due to being disconnected and isolated from yourself not from others. Without a secure sense of identity. It would be extremely difficult to form 
a healthy relationship with someone else. Do you feel this is the case for you. 

- You have unrealistic standards knowing your own worth and respecting yourself enough not to settle for less than what you deserve is definitely a good thing. 
However you should not be careful not to set the bar too high for anyone to climb, are you asking too much from your potential partners? if you've been searching for that special
someone for a long time and no one even comes close. There's possibility that your idea of a perfect partner simple doesn't exist.
No body is going to have all the same interest and passions as you or immediately know what to do or how to act around you, movies and books can often 
give us unrealistic expectations about love and romance seeing all those perfect relationships on social media may also make it hard for you to settle down. 

- You are still heart broken. Are you thinking of dating someone new even though you're still hung up on your ex, you might think that getting over someone means finding a replacement 
for them, but rushing into things is never a good idea. This is why rebound relationships don't often work out no matter how much time has passed. Whether it's been weeks months or even years.
You shouldn't be looking for a new partner yet. If you're still nursing a broken heart from your last failed romance instead allow yourself all the time you need to heal and truly let person go
It may do some good to get comfortable with being single for a while before you put your heart on the line again. After all recovering from a breakup can lead to tremendous self growth and 
improved quality of life. 

- You are afraid of commitment according to Robert's famous triarchic theory of love, commitments and intimacy are fundamental elements of a lasting 
relationships along with passion. do you only want the thrill and excitement of new love and don't think you're ready to be in a serious 
relationship quiet yet. It's ok be afraid of commitment. But it's better to understand why to be vulnerable and open yourself up to others or is it because
you don't want to feel trapped in a relationship with someone else, are you afraid of rejection and abandonment. So you leave to deny other people a chance to leave you or
do you simply not believe that a relationship is meant to last, until you figure yourself out first and understand why it is you're so afraid of commitment. you'll only continue to drive
people away and never move forward from the courtship stage of dating. 

- You don't have time to date another reason why you might be struggling in your search for romance is that you're simple too busy to be dating right now whether 
it's your career your academics or your personal life taking up a lot of your time. It can be hard for you to find someone when you're preoccupied with so many other things at the moment.
It's perfectly fine if being in a relationship is not one of your priorities right now especially if you're still young. Nonetheless if you are really serious about wanting to settle down 
with someone already. Then you should make a few adjustments to your schedule. 

- Finally, you're single by choice, do you value your independence and don't want to be tied down yet. Do you want to focus on 
other aspects of your life first, maybe you still sorting out your own issues and trying to navigate your way through life.
Whatever your reason maybe, It's good to be honest with yourself about what it is you want and don't want. You don't need a relationship to be happy, take everything at your own pace.
At the end of the day a relationship is a want not a need and you should want it for the right reasons, if you want someone to save you or 
take care of you or you not happy with yourself in your life rushing into a relationship is not the answer. On the other hand if you're too busy with your career still pining over someone else
or dating too aggressively, you won't attract the right kind of people, once you understand why it is you're still single and what you can do about it only then can you start to connect 
better with other people, this makes it easier for you to find someone who's good match for you, fall in love with them and make 
your relationship last.
