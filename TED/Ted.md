### Slow your time

If you are luck enough to decide to pace that you want to travel through your life, it's a privilege.

You might decide that you need both to speed up and to create slow time, time to reflect, to percolate at your own pace.

### How to declutter your mind

I believe we are responsible for creating the moments of joy in our own life.

We can't take credit for a beautiful sunrise, but we can take credit for being there to see it.

That's why I am very excited to be here today to share some of what I've learned with you.

What people have the capacity to choose they have ability to change. 

Declutter your mind by creating a mental inventory. Get rid of the things that don't matter.

Focus on things that interest you by designing small actionable projects.

Get into a daily habit of updating your mental inventory.

The intentional life has the power to grant you more of those beautiful moments in the sun.


### How to move through insecurities

I've always believed that to feel really good about ourselves it's important as I call it to be lit up in life.

I moved through insecurities and tapped into that passion and purpose.

All to search for life meaning, I was lonely.

If you were able to acknowledge those negative thoughts and let them go, and then turn the volume 
and the noise down.

What would you open up for you and what would be possible? Unlimited possible, no speed limit.

I encourage you to take time out every day for self-reflection. 


### How do we break free of our habitual negative bias of our brain towards stressful state?

Generally, stress refers to tension, but angry, fear, hurt, loneliness, frustration are all stressful state.

Beautiful state is a state of connection, joy, love, compassion, vitality and passion.

If you are not a beautiful state, your default state is stress.

If you look at the entirety of human life, behind war or peace, cooperation or corrosive politics,
love or separation, persistence or failure behind all these is the driving force of these two states.

In a beautiful state, there is no compulsive illumination f the past or anxiety over the future.

It's a state where experience inner simplicity and a brilliance of an uncluttered mind.

Realizing that all lingering and suffering is a total preoccupation with oneself. That's an obsessive self-centric thinking, is the
most powerful antidote.

Paying more attention to yourself leads to disconnection from others and always tangles the past or fears the future,
which is the source of stress. Focus more on other things and experience the feelings of others that needed.

### We all see the world through our mind's eyes.

But if you asked the person on your left, they might have said regret and skepticism, and if you asked
somebody on your right, they might have said somethings entirely different, like hope or empathy.

Perception is subjective. What we think we see is actually filtered through our own mind's eye.

So to begin to track this questions, my research team and I decide to delve deeply into an issue that have received international attention:
our health and fit.

Across the world, people are struggling to manage their weight and their is a variety of strategies.

Keeping your eyes on the price, made the exercise look and feel easier, even when people were working hard because they were moving faster.

We all see the world through our own mind's eye, but we can teach ourselves to see it differently.

In some days, It might look like the world is a dangerous and challenging and insurmountable place, but It does't 
have to look that way all the time. We can teach ourselves to see it differently, and when we find a way to make the world look nice and easier.

### Objectives and Key Results

We are at a critical moment, our leader and some instruction haven't taken us to the wrong objectives.

How are we going to choose the right course?

They set meaningful and audacious goals, the right goals for the right reasons.

It almost doesn't matter what you know, execution is what matters the most.

Objectives and Key Results, or OKRs, are a simple goal-setting system and they work for organizations, they work for teams,
they even work for individuals.

The objectives are what you want to have accomplished. The key results are how I'm going to get the done.

A lot of organizations set objectives and meet them, they ship their sales, they introduce their new products, they make their numbers.
but they lack a sense of purpose to inspire their teams. 

OKRs cultivate the madness, and magic is right around the corner. That is perfect.

A good results are specific and time-bound. They are aggressive but realistic. They are measurable, and they're verifiable.

These are not used for bonuses or for promotions. They used for the high purpose and that's go to the collective commitment to truly stretch goals.

OKRs are not a sliver bullet. They're not going to be a substitute for a strong culture or for strong leadership, but when those fundamentals are 
in place, they can take you to the mountaintop.

Let's fight for what it is that really matters, because we can take OKRs beyond our business. We can take them to our families, to our schools, even to our governments.

We can transform those information. We can back to the right track, if we can and do measure what really matters. 

### The hidden power of smile

When I was a child, I always wanted to be a superhero. I wanted to save the world and make everyone happy.

I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science, to find a more useful truth.

The researchers found that the span of a player's smile could actually predict the span of his life.

Smiling is one of the most basic, biologically uniform expressions of all humans.

We smile often, and use smiles to express joy and satisfaction.

Outside of this room, more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day, whereas less than 14 percent of us smile.

By showing that facial feedback, modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain, in a way that helps us feel better when we smile.

Smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate, a well-regarded pleasure inducer can not match.

When you smile, you don't only appear to be more likable and courteous, but you actually appear to be more competent.

So whenever you want to look great and competent, reduce your stress, or improve your marriage, 
that will help you and everyone around you live a longer, healthier, happier life, smile.  


### How disease spread all around the world?

We live in an interconnected, an increasingly globalized world. Thanks international jet travel, people and the disease they carry
can be in any city on the planet in a matter of hours.

And once a virus touches down, sometimes all it takes is one sneeze to speed the infection throughout the community.

When humans were hunter-gatherers, roaming the wild savannas, we were never in one place long enough, and settlement were 
not large enough to sustain the transmission of infectious microbes.

In the Middle East, people began living side-by-side animals, facilitating the spread of bacteria and viruses between cattle and humans.

But the most common cause of epidemics are viruses, such as measles, influenza and HIV. And we they go global, we call them pandemics.

The first indication of the pandemic came in Spring, when American troops in northern France began complaining of chills, headaches and fever.

He was harboring a new animal-origin virus called SARS, short for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.

SARS was a reminder that pandemics have always been associated with panic.

If history teaches us anything, it's that while pandemics may start small, their impacts can be as dramatic
as wars and natural disasters.

The different today is that science gives us the ability to detect pandemics right at the very beginning 
and to take action to mitigate their impacts before they spread too widely.


### The way to overcome FOBO

You're probably familiar with FOMO, that's short of "Fear Of Missing Out".

Everyone do something better than what you are doing now.

It's far more dangerous, it's called FOBO, and it's short for "Fear Of a Better Option".

We live in a world of overwhelming choice, even the decisions that used to be simple, like choosing a restaurant or making everyday purchases are 
fraught with over analysis.

Technology has only made the issue more pronounced.

Chances are you've experienced FOBO when you struggled to choose just one from a group of perfectly acceptable outcomes.

It's a symptom of a culture which sees value in collecting and preserving as many options as possible.

Shouldn't it be a privilege to have so many good options to choose from.

The problem is, FOBO induces such server analysis paralysis that it can negatively impact both personal and professional life.

When you can't make a decisions with conviction, you waste precious and energy.

With any decision you make, you first have to determine the stakes as this will inform your
decision-making strategy.

You only really face three types of decisions in life: high stakes, low stakes and no stakes.

Something is in required but these aren't make-or-break deliberations and you probably forget about them in a few weeks.

The FOBO comes when you struggle to choose just one from a group of perfectly acceptable options.

So no matter what you choose, you can rest assured that the downside is limited.

You have plentiful opportunities to live decisively, you may not get everything you want, but the mere fact you get to decide is powerful.


### How to make a career change?

In the last 15 years of my career, I've been an English teacher, attorney, video game creator and now a 
toilet paper salesman, selling millions of rolls of toilet paper a year.

I then came upon the epiphany that takes years if not tens of thousands of hours to get really good at something.
I really didn't have a lot of time to waste.

First, the there things to think about before you're ready to move on:
- Professional life is about learning.
- Career changes are often gut-driven.
- Pain shouldn't be a factor.

You're convinced that it's time to change your career:
- Go out the network and meet new people.
- Shore up your finances.
- Learn to side hustles.

If you're ready made the move, the three things you should think about doing:
- Do not burn bridges.
- Take stock what you've learned.
- Don't worry, take a deep breath.


### How to improve the 

A few years ago, my obsession with productivity got so bad that I suffered 
an episode of burnout that scared the hell out of me.

I'm talking insomnia, wight gain, hair loss - the works, I was so overworked.
that my brain literally couldn't come up with another idea.

That indicated to me that my identity was linked with this idea of productivity.

Do you feel guilty if you haven't been productive enough during the day? Do you spend hours reading productivity hacks, trying
new frameworks and testing new apps to get even more done?
I've tried them all things that are meant to manage your day.

We've been so obsessed with doing more that we've missing the most important thing.

Historically, productivity as we know it today was used during the industrial revolution. It was a system that measured performance
based on consistent output.

When we shifted to a knowledge economy, people suddenly had tasks that were more abstract things
like writing, problem-solving or strategizing, tasks that weren't easy to measure.

Companies struggled to figure out how to tell who was working and who wasn't, so they just adopted
the old systems as best as they could, leading to the things like the dreaded time sheet, where everyone is under pressure.
to justify how they spend every second of their day. These systems don't make a lot of sense for creative work.

We still think of productivity as an endurance sport. You try to churn out as many blog posts or we cram our day full of meetings. 
But this model of constant output isn't conducive to creative thought.

Today, knowledge workers are facing a big challenge. We're expected to be constantly producing and creative is equal measure.
But our brains to continuously generate new ideas with no rest. In fact, downtime is a necessity for our brain to recovery and to operate properly.

Let our minds wander is an essential mental state that helps us develop our identity.
process social interactions and even influences our internal moral compass.

Our need for a break flies in the face of our cultural narrative about hustling.
In other words, the stories that we as a society tell each other about what success looks like and what 
it takes to get there.

Everyone has their own narratives that they have to uncover, It wasn't until I started digging around my own beliefs around the work
that I began to unravel the root of my own work story, finally being able to let go of destructive behaviors.
and make positive, long-lasting changes.

And the only way to do that is by asking yourself some hard questions. Does being busy make you feel valuable?
Who do you hold up as an example of success? Where did your ideas of work ethic come from? How much of how you are and is linked to
what you do?

You creativity, it has its own rhythms, our energy fluctuates daily, even seasonally. 

- Dismantling myths
- Challenging your old views


###

We do have a problem thought, and that is the most important relationship we have in our lives
is one we have with ourselves and we are not taught about it.

I want to challenge you to think about if we were taught how to look after ourselves using self-care.
could we help enrich our lives, make us happier, combat our insecurities and enable us to reach our full potential?

Body image is often associated with teenage girls.
Eating disorders and mental health can affect anyone at any age, at any time.


So I decided to use those experiences that i've had to gain a better understanding of the relationship.
I have with my body and myself. And by practicing self-care, I was able to change my life. If you haven't already started, to start the journal of self-love.

It's crazy these days, we have so many pressures, and now we have social media, with the rise of social media, 
we literaly have a weapon of mass destruction to our self-esteem 24/7.

Social media is a curated, filtered, often airbrushed and sometimes even lifestyle illusion.
That's why we need to be taught about it how to cope with these pressures in schools. We need to 
taught how to look after ourselves mentally, physically and emotionally.

The main concept we teach is the "beauty ideal myth", we get all of kids to have magazines and pick up the 
perfect body. It's so detrimental to your mental and physical health. 

I'm so grateful I've been here today and able to connect with you all, because I want to encourage every single one of you
to invest in yourself right now. I want to you understand that if you learn self-care, practice self-care, you can get the gift
self-care. Imaging being able to give your loved ones, the gift of self-love. Speaking to your body in a loving way. It's the only
one you've got. It's your home and it deserves your respect. If you see anyone tearing themselves down, build them back up.
And watch your life positively grow, when you give up the pursuit of perfection. Because the real beauty ideal is being imperfectly you
Thank you so much, everybody.
 

### The six steps to improve your emotional intelligence ?

I want to start with doing a small survey with you. For that, please puts your hands into your laps and close your eye.

I want to be honest with you, emotional intelligence is not necessarily my main strength. When I make decisions, I based 
them solely on my rational.

Five years ago, when I dropped out of a job because of a burnout. It was then that my very emotional side was 
revealed, and while I rarely cried before, especially not in front of people, I just couldn't stop the tears from 
streaming down my face at the most inconvenient of times anymore.

It has a bad connotation, describing a person having or expressing strong feelings. It's describing a person having and 
expressing strong feeling.

It's the ability to identify and manage your emotions and those of others, and it's set to include three skills:
- emotional awareness: empathy, empathy towards others but also towards the self
- the ability to harness motions and apply them to tasks like problem solving
- the ability to manage emotions, which includes regulating your own emotions and cheering up
or calming down other people

We first of all need to consider emotional intelligence as a curial skill in our society, and then
also take the time to consciously work on it.

I tried to compile my experiences and came up with six-step guide that hopefully helps people to get more emotional intelligence.
- Acknowledge Emotions 
- Differentiate and Analysis Emotions
- Accept and Appreciate Emotions
- Reflect on your Emotions and Their Origin
- Handle your emotions
- Handle the emotions of others
