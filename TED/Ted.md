### Slow your time

If you are luck enough to decide to pace that you want to travel through your life, it's a privilege.

You might decide that you need both to speed up and to create slow time, time to reflect, to percolate at your own pace.

### How to declutter your mind

I believe we are responsible for creating the moments of joy in our own life.

We can't take credit for a beautiful sunrise, but we can take credit for being there to see it.

That's why I am very excited to be here today to share some of what I've learned with you.

What people have the capacity to choose they have ability to change. 

Declutter your mind by creating a mental inventory. Get rid of the things that don't matter.

Focus on things that interest you by designing small actionable projects.

Get into a daily habit of updating your mental inventory.

The intentional life has the power to grant you more of those beautiful moments in the sun.


### How to move through insecurities

I've always believed that to feel really good about ourselves it's important as I call it to be lit up in life.

I moved through insecurities and tapped into that passion and purpose.

All to search for life meaning, I was lonely.

If you were able to acknowledge those negative thoughts and let them go, and then turn the volume 
and the noise down.

What would you open up for you and what would be possible? Unlimited possible, no speed limit.

I encourage you to take time out every day for self-reflection. 


### How do we break free of our habitual negative bias of our brain towards stressful state?

Generally, stress refers to tension, but angry, fear, hurt, loneliness, frustration are all stressful state.

Beautiful state is a state of connection, joy, love, compassion, vitality and passion.

If you are not a beautiful state, your default state is stress.

If you look at the entirety of human life, behind war or peace, cooperation or corrosive politics,
love or separation, persistence or failure behind all these is the driving force of these two states.

In a beautiful state, there is no compulsive illumination f the past or anxiety over the future.

It's a state where experience inner simplicity and a brilliance of an uncluttered mind.

Realizing that all lingering and suffering is a total preoccupation with oneself. That's an obsessive self-centric thinking, is the
most powerful antidote.

Paying more attention to yourself leads to disconnection from others and always tangles the past or fears the future,
which is the source of stress. Focus more on other things and experience the feelings of others that needed.

### We all see the world through our mind's eyes.

But if you asked the person on your left, they might have said regret and skepticism, and if you asked
somebody on your right, they might have said somethings entirely different, like hope or empathy.

Perception is subjective. What we think we see is actually filtered through our own mind's eye.

So to begin to track this questions, my research team and I decide to delve deeply into an issue that have received international attention:
our health and fit.

Across the world, people are struggling to manage their weight and their is a variety of strategies.

Keeping your eyes on the price, made the exercise look and feel easier, even when people were working hard because they were moving faster.

We all see the world through our own mind's eye, but we can teach ourselves to see it differently.

In some days, It might look like the world is a dangerous and challenging and insurmountable place, but It does't 
have to look that way all the time. We can teach ourselves to see it differently, and when we find a way to make the world look nice and easier.

### Objectives and Key Results

We are at a critical moment, our leader and some instruction haven't taken us to the wrong objectives.

How are we going to choose the right course?

They set meaningful and audacious goals, the right goals for the right reasons.

It almost doesn't matter what you know, execution is what matters the most.

Objectives and Key Results, or OKRs, are a simple goal-setting system and they work for organizations, they work for teams,
they even work for individuals.

The objectives are what you want to have accomplished. The key results are how I'm going to get the done.

A lot of organizations set objectives and meet them, they ship their sales, they introduce their new products, they make their numbers.
but they lack a sense of purpose to inspire their teams. 

OKRs cultivate the madness, and magic is right around the corner. That is perfect.

A good results are specific and time-bound. They are aggressive but realistic. They are measurable, and they're verifiable.

These are not used for bonuses or for promotions. They used for the high purpose and that's go to the collective commitment to truly stretch goals.

OKRs are not a sliver bullet. They're not going to be a substitute for a strong culture or for strong leadership, but when those fundamentals are 
in place, they can take you to the mountaintop.

Let's fight for what it is that really matters, because we can take OKRs beyond our business. We can take them to our families, to our schools, even to our governments.

We can transform those information. We can back to the right track, if we can and do measure what really matters. 

### The hidden power of smile

When I was a child, I always wanted to be a superhero. I wanted to save the world and make everyone happy.

I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science, to find a more useful truth.

The researchers found that the span of a player's smile could actually predict the span of his life.

Smiling is one of the most basic, biologically uniform expressions of all humans.

We smile often, and use smiles to express joy and satisfaction.

Outside of this room, more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day, whereas less than 14 percent of us smile.

By showing that facial feedback, modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain, in a way that helps us feel better when we smile.

Smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate, a well-regarded pleasure inducer can not match.

When you smile, you don't only appear to be more likable and courteous, but you actually appear to be more competent.

So whenever you want to look great and competent, reduce your stress, or improve your marriage, 
that will help you and everyone around you live a longer, healthier, happier life, smile.  


### How disease spread all around the world?

We live in an interconnected, an increasingly globalized world. Thanks international jet travel, people and the disease they carry
can be in any city on the planet in a matter of hours.

And once a virus touches down, sometimes all it takes is one sneeze to speed the infection throughout the community.

When humans were hunter-gatherers, roaming the wild savannas, we were never in one place long enough, and settlement were 
not large enough to sustain the transmission of infectious microbes.

In the Middle East, people began living side-by-side animals, facilitating the spread of bacteria and viruses between cattle and humans.

But the most common cause of epidemics are viruses, such as measles, influenza and HIV. And we they go global, we call them pandemics.

The first indication of the pandemic came in Spring, when American troops in northern France began complaining of chills, headaches and fever.

He was harboring a new animal-origin virus called SARS, short for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.

SARS was a reminder that pandemics have always been associated with panic.

If history teaches us anything, it's that while pandemics may start small, their impacts can be as dramatic
as wars and natural disasters.

The different today is that science gives us the ability to detect pandemics right at the very beginning 
and to take action to mitigate their impacts before they spread too widely.


### The way to overcome FOBO

You're probably familiar with FOMO, that's short of "Fear Of Missing Out".

Everyone do something better than what you are doing now.

It's far more dangerous, it's called FOBO, and it's short for "Fear Of a Better Option".

We live in a world of overwhelming choice, even the decisions that used to be simple, like choosing a restaurant or making everyday purchases are 
fraught with over analysis.

Technology has only made the issue more pronounced.

Chances are you've experienced FOBO when you struggled to choose just one from a group of perfectly acceptable outcomes.

It's a symptom of a culture which sees value in collecting and preserving as many options as possible.

Shouldn't it be a privilege to have so many good options to choose from.

The problem is, FOBO induces such server analysis paralysis that it can negatively impact both personal and professional life.

When you can't make a decisions with conviction, you waste precious and energy.

With any decision you make, you first have to determine the stakes as this will inform your
decision-making strategy.

You only really face three types of decisions in life: high stakes, low stakes and no stakes.

Something is in required but these aren't make-or-break deliberations and you probably forget about them in a few weeks.

The FOBO comes when you struggle to choose just one from a group of perfectly acceptable options.

So no matter what you choose, you can rest assured that the downside is limited.

You have plentiful opportunities to live decisively, you may not get everything you want, but the mere fact you get to decide is powerful.


### How to make a career change?

In the last 15 years of my career, I've been an English teacher, attorney, video game creator and now a 
toilet paper salesman, selling millions of rolls of toilet paper a year.

I then came upon the epiphany that takes years if not tens of thousands of hours to get really good at something.
I really didn't have a lot of time to waste.

First, the there things to think about before you're ready to move on:
- Professional life is about learning.
- Career changes are often gut-driven.
- Pain shouldn't be a factor.

You're convinced that it's time to change your career:
- Go out the network and meet new people.
- Shore up your finances.
- Learn to side hustles.

If you're ready made the move, the three things you should think about doing:
- Do not burn bridges.
- Take stock what you've learned.
- Don't worry, take a deep breath.


### How to improve the 

A few years ago, my obsession with productivity got so bad that I suffered 
an episode of burnout that scared the hell out of me.

I'm talking insomnia, wight gain, hair loss - the works, I was so overworked.
that my brain literally couldn't come up with another idea.

That indicated to me that my identity was linked with this idea of productivity.

Do you feel guilty if you haven't been productive enough during the day? Do you spend hours reading productivity hacks, trying
new frameworks and testing new apps to get even more done?
I've tried them all things that are meant to manage your day.

We've been so obsessed with doing more that we've missing the most important thing.

Historically, productivity as we know it today was used during the industrial revolution. It was a system that measured performance
based on consistent output.

When we shifted to a knowledge economy, people suddenly had tasks that were more abstract things
like writing, problem-solving or strategizing, tasks that weren't easy to measure.

Companies struggled to figure out how to tell who was working and who wasn't, so they just adopted
the old systems as best as they could, leading to the things like the dreaded time sheet, where everyone is under pressure.
to justify how they spend every second of their day. These systems don't make a lot of sense for creative work.

We still think of productivity as an endurance sport. You try to churn out as many blog posts or we cram our day full of meetings. 
But this model of constant output isn't conducive to creative thought.

Today, knowledge workers are facing a big challenge. We're expected to be constantly producing and creative is equal measure.
But our brains to continuously generate new ideas with no rest. In fact, downtime is a necessity for our brain to recovery and to operate properly.

Let our minds wander is an essential mental state that helps us develop our identity.
process social interactions and even influences our internal moral compass.

Our need for a break flies in the face of our cultural narrative about hustling.
In other words, the stories that we as a society tell each other about what success looks like and what 
it takes to get there.

Everyone has their own narratives that they have to uncover, It wasn't until I started digging around my own beliefs around the work
that I began to unravel the root of my own work story, finally being able to let go of destructive behaviors.
and make positive, long-lasting changes.

And the only way to do that is by asking yourself some hard questions. Does being busy make you feel valuable?
Who do you hold up as an example of success? Where did your ideas of work ethic come from? How much of how you are and is linked to
what you do?

You creativity, it has its own rhythms, our energy fluctuates daily, even seasonally. 

- Dismantling myths
- Challenging your old views


###

We do have a problem thought, and that is the most important relationship we have in our lives
is one we have with ourselves and we are not taught about it.

I want to challenge you to think about if we were taught how to look after ourselves using self-care.
could we help enrich our lives, make us happier, combat our insecurities and enable us to reach our full potential?

Body image is often associated with teenage girls.
Eating disorders and mental health can affect anyone at any age, at any time.


So I decided to use those experiences that i've had to gain a better understanding of the relationship.
I have with my body and myself. And by practicing self-care, I was able to change my life. If you haven't already started, to start the journal of self-love.

It's crazy these days, we have so many pressures, and now we have social media, with the rise of social media, 
we literaly have a weapon of mass destruction to our self-esteem 24/7.

Social media is a curated, filtered, often airbrushed and sometimes even lifestyle illusion.
That's why we need to be taught about it how to cope with these pressures in schools. We need to 
taught how to look after ourselves mentally, physically and emotionally.

The main concept we teach is the "beauty ideal myth", we get all of kids to have magazines and pick up the 
perfect body. It's so detrimental to your mental and physical health. 

I'm so grateful I've been here today and able to connect with you all, because I want to encourage every single one of you
to invest in yourself right now. I want to you understand that if you learn self-care, practice self-care, you can get the gift
self-care. Imaging being able to give your loved ones, the gift of self-love. Speaking to your body in a loving way. It's the only
one you've got. It's your home and it deserves your respect. If you see anyone tearing themselves down, build them back up.
And watch your life positively grow, when you give up the pursuit of perfection. Because the real beauty ideal is being imperfectly you
Thank you so much, everybody.
 

### The six steps to improve your emotional intelligence ?

I want to start with doing a small survey with you. For that, please puts your hands into your laps and close your eye.

I want to be honest with you, emotional intelligence is not necessarily my main strength. When I make decisions, I based 
them solely on my rational.

Five years ago, when I dropped out of a job because of a burnout. It was then that my very emotional side was 
revealed, and while I rarely cried before, especially not in front of people, I just couldn't stop the tears from 
streaming down my face at the most inconvenient of times anymore.

It has a bad connotation, describing a person having or expressing strong feelings. It's describing a person having and 
expressing strong feeling.

It's the ability to identify and manage your emotions and those of others, and it's set to include three skills:
- emotional awareness: empathy, empathy towards others but also towards the self
- the ability to harness motions and apply them to tasks like problem solving
- the ability to manage emotions, which includes regulating your own emotions and cheering up
or calming down other people

We first of all need to consider emotional intelligence as a curial skill in our society, and then
also take the time to consciously work on it.

I tried to compile my experiences and came up with six-step guide that hopefully helps people to get more emotional intelligence.
- Acknowledge Emotions 
- Differentiate and Analysis Emotions
- Accept and Appreciate Emotions
- Reflect on your Emotions and Their Origin
- Handle your emotions
- Handle the emotions of others


### What causes recessions?

For millennia, the people of Britain had been using bronze to make tools and jewelry and as a currency for trade.
But around 800 BCE, the began to change: the value of bronze declined, causing social upheaval and an economic crisis
what we would call a recession today.

This question has long been a subject of heated debate among economists, and for good reason.
A recession can be a mild decline in economic activity in single country that lasts months, a
long-lasting downturn with global ramifications that last years, or anything in between.

There're countless variables that contribute to an economic's health, making it difficult to 
pinpoint specific causes.

Recession occur when there is a negative disruption to the balance between supply and demand.
There's a mismatch between how goods people want to buy, how many products and services products can offer,
and prices of goods and services sold, which prompts an economic decline.

An economy's relationship between supply and demand is reflected in its inflation rates and interest rates.
Inflation happens when goods and services get more expensive. Put another way, the value of money decreases.
Still, inflation isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, a low inflation rate is thought to encourage economic
activity. But high inflation that isn't accompanied with high demand can both cause problems for economic and eventually
lead to recession.

Interest rate, meanwhile, reflect the cost of taking on debt for individuals and companies. The rate is typically
an annual percentage of a loan that borrowers pay to their creditors until the loan is rapid.
Low interest rates mean that companies can afford to borrow more money, which they can used to invest in more
projects. High interest rates, meanwhile, increase rates for producers and consumers, slowing the economic activity.

Fluctuations in inflation and interest rates can give us insight into the health of economy, but what causes these fluctuations
in the first place?
- The most obvious causes are shocks like natural disaster, war and geopolitical factors.
An earthquake can destroy the infrastructure needed to produce important commodities such as oil.

- Some recessions occur in times of economic prosperity, possible even because of economic prosperity.
The business activity can occasionally reach an unsustainable level, corporations and consumers may borrow
more money with the assumption that economic growth will help them handle the added burden. But if the 
economic doesn't grow as quickly as expected, they may end up with more debt than they can manage.
To pay it off, they'll have to redirect funds from other activities, reducing business activity.

- Psychology can also contribute to a recessions. Fear of a recessions can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
if it causes people to pull back investing and spending. In response, producers might cut operating costs to help
weather the expected delcine in demand. That can lead to a vicious cycle as cost cuts eventually lower wages.
leading to even lower demand.

- Even policy designed to help prevent recessions can contribute. When times are though, governments and central banks may
print money, increase spending, and lower central bank interest rates. Smaller lenders can in turn lower their interests rates,
effectively making debt "cheaper" to boost spending. But these policies are not sustainable and eventually need to be reversed.
These cause a recession if people have become too reliant on cheap debt and government stimulus.

Each recession provides new data to help anticipate and response to future recessions more effectively.

### What happen if you get infected with the coronavirus?

As of the morning of February 27，2020， there were at least 82000 confirmed cases worldwide of the coronavirus and 
2810 deaths from it.

There are certain people who get infected and have very serious illness among them are health workers.
It's a very serious inflection in them as they get a higher does than normal people. At the same time, they have no immunity.
So in general population, it's likely that does of virus that you receive with you are infected is much less
than the does that a health worker would receive. Health worker having more serious infections.
So that leaves the elderly and those with comorbidities to really be the ones that we have to make sure.
are taken care of in hospitals. 

The most concerned are people, who are, first of all, in developing countries, and who don't have access to good medical care
and may not have access at all to a hospital, should an epidemic occur in their country.

First of all, pulmonary disease exciting as a comorbidity is also important. in general, the elderly are at greater risk.
especially those over 70, because their immune systems are not as effective as they might have once been and they are more 
susceptible to inflections.

It's our responsibility to get the information as individuals, so we understand, and make sure that we can contribute in our own way.
to prevention of major spread.

This is an infection that's coming to humans who have never been exposed to this virus before. They don't have any antibody protections.
and it's not clear whether their immune system can handle this virus or not. This is a virus that usually finds itself in bats or in other 
animals, and all of a sudden, it's in humans. Humans just don't have experiences with this virus.

It's clearly understand that airports or any land borders cannot prevent a disease from entering. 
People in the incubation period can cross the border can enter countries and can then infect others when they become sick.
So borders are not a means of preventing infections from entering a country by checking temperatures. 

Vaccines are under development right now, there's a lot of research going on. That research requires first that the vaccine be developed.
then that it be studied for safety and effectiveness in animals, who are challenged with the virus after they are vaccinated,
and then it must go into human studies.

We will eventually have more and more of these outbreaks. So an emerging inflection today is just a warning.
of what will happen in the future. We have to make sure that technical collaboration in the world is their to work together to make 
sure that we can understand these outbreaks when they occur and rapidly provide the information necessary to control them.

### What is beauty?

Galton is a brilliant polymath. He's an explorer, an anthropologist, a sociologist, a psychologist and a statistician.
He presents a new technique by which he can combine photographs and produce composite portraits.
This technology could be used to characterize different types of people. If he combines photographs of violent criminals,
he will discover the face of criminality.

- The composite or average faces are typically more attractive than each individual face that contributes to the average.
has been replicated many times.

- The second factor that contributes to beauty is symmetry. People generally find symmetric faces more attractive than asymmetric ones.

- The third factor that contributes to facial attractiveness is the effect of hormones.
Men typically find women attractive who have elements of both youth and maturity.

Attractive faces activate parts of our visual cortex in the back of brain, an area called the fusiform gyrus, that is especially tuned 
to processing faces, and an adjacent area called the lateral occipital complex, that is especially attuned to processing objects.
In addition, attractive faces activate parts of our reward and pleasure centers in the front and deep in the brain and these 
include areas that have complicated names, like the ventral striatum, the orbitofrontal cortex and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

Our visual brain that is tuned to processing faces, interacts with our pleasure centers to underpin the experiences of beauty.
Amazingly, when we all engage with beauty, without our knowledge, beauty also engages us.
Our brains respond to attractive faces, even when we're not thinking about beauty.
Taken together, these studies suggest that our brain automatically responds to beauty by linking vision and pleasure.
Our brains seem to reflexively associate beauty and good. And this reflexive association may be the biologic trigger for many
social effects of beauty.

Attractiveness people receive all kinds of advantages in life. They're regards as intelligent, more trustworthy, they'r given
higher pay and lesser punishments, even when such judgements are not warranted. Unfortunately, we also have a "disfigured is bad" stereotype.

Beauty is a work in process. The so-called universal attributes of beauty were selected for during almost two millions years
of the Pleistocene. Life was nasty, brutish and a very long time age. The selection criteria for reproductive success from that time, don't 
really apply today. And under this relaxed conditions, preferences and trait combinations are free to drift and become more variable.
Even as we are profoundly affecting our environment, modern medicine and technological innovation is profoundly affecting 
the very essence of what it means to look beautiful. The universal nature of beauty is changing, even as we changing the universe.


### How some kids get tracked towards college and others towards detention?

My first job out of college was an academic researcher at one of the largest juvenile detention centers in the country.
And everyday I would drive to this building on the West Side of Chicago, go through the security checkpoint and walk down
these brown, brick hallways as I made my way down to the basement to observe the intake process.

And as I set there on the side of glasses from them, idealistic with a college degree, I wondered to my self: Why didn't schools
do something more to prevent this from happening?

I've learned that so much of this problem is systemic that often our school system perpetuates the social divide. It make worse
what it's supported to fix. That's as crazy or controversial as saying that our health care system isn't preventative.
but somehow profits off of keeping us sick.

If we are serious about helping more kids from across the board to achieve and make it in this world, we are going to have to realized that 
our gaps in student outcomes are not so much about achievements as much as they are opportunity.

Lower resource schools are dealing with lower quality equipment, obsolete technology and paying teachers way less.

But for who knows how long authorities have turned a blind eye to those who can bribe their way onto the most elite and beautiful
college campuses. A public education system should not create a wider bottom and more narrow top.
Some of us can sometimes think that these things aren't that close to home, but they are if we broaden our view, because a leaky
faucet in our kitchen, broken radiator in our hallway those part of our house that we always say we're going to get to next week.
they're devaluing our whole property. Why don't we try to reclaim the promise of public education and remember that it's our greatest
collective responsibility?

And sometime for the student, innovation is just daring to implement common sense. I recently researched these partnerships being built
between high schools, community colleges and local businesses, who are creating internships in finance, health care and technology.
for students without "sliver spoon" connections to gain important skills and contribute to the communities that they come from.

It's not: Can school save more of our students? Because I think we have the answer to that and it's yes they can, if we save our school first.
We can start by caring about the education of others people's children. Cultivating as much talent as possible, getting as many girls as we
can from all over into science and engineering, as many boys as we can into teaching those are investments for our future.

Our students are like our most valuable resources, and when you put it that way, our teachers are like our modern-day diamond and gold miners,
hoping to help make them shine. Let's contribute our voices, our votes and our support to giving them the resources that they will need not just to survive.
but hopefully thrive, allowing all of us to do so as well.


### fan girl

Four years ago, a teenage girls changed my life in one conversation. She casually told me that she had met the man she was going to marry.
And she told me that his name is Harry Styles. And that was the moment that I became obsessed with fangirls
I didn't know it them but that moment would transform the course of my life and go on to change everything that I thought I knew and being a adult.

A fangirl is a 'girl' or woman who is an extremely or overly enthusiastic fan of someone or something.
Technically, you can have fangirls of anything, but my specific interest was in fangirls of boy bands.
Because of their somewhat lethal(致命的) reputation(名气). 

Harry Styles was a member of One Direction. Harry Styles was reputed for his compassionate demeanor and perfect hair.
I learn this when I read thousand of tweets about him. I learn that he is a sweet cupcake. L learn that he was a perfect angle.

I read hours of fan fiction and I fall down this specific rabbit hole of stories that actually place me as protagonist inside of various
imagined romances with him. So in one, I tell him that I'm pregnant with his child. In another, we meat in hospital where we're both fighting cancer.
And in another, we fall so deeply in love that we become fugitives who kill people. 

But then, something unthinkable happens, One directions, the biggest boy band on the planet, loses a member. Zayn Malik quits the band,
and the internet explodes with feels. I read tweets as these girls describe the physical pain of this loss, how they can't eat or sleep or walk.
I read them describe how much Zayn had meat to them. And I watch videos of 10-year-old girls crying.
Then I watch as mainstream news outlets cover the story. I read them describe these 'young banshees'. I read one journalist say: It's commonly known 
fact since the age of Beatles that there is nothing scarier in this world than a group of excited teenage girls.

Then I asked myself a questions I've never consider in my life. Why is it that the image of young girls screaming their lungs out with excitement for a pop star
is considered crazy, psycho, scary, a bit much? But the image of young boys screaming their lungs out for a footballer is perfectly normal?
As soon as I realized this double standard, I realized that all of my curiosity about fangirls has been sparked by exactly the same judgements.
I, too, has suspected that they were a bit crazy. I'd looked at images of girls screaming for the Beatles and the world had come to mind was not "excitement", was hysteria.
Hysteria was considered to be a legitimate female mental disorder that could be diagnosed by doctors if women displayed excessive emotion or difficult behavior.

I decide to redeclare my obsession. Because I am no longer just obsessed with fangirls. Now I'am obsessed with the way that the world talks about fangirls.
and the way the world looks at young, female enthusiasm. I want to know, if girls grow up in a world where words like 'crazy', 'psycho', and 'hysterical' are casually used to describe 
female enthusiasm, then how does that shape the way that those girls get to see themselves? And if girls grow up in a world that tells them
that they are designed just a bit crazier than the boys, then it's that a little bit like telling them that they are born less
capable of rationality than men, less capable of reason and unworthy of the same intellectual respect as their brothers.

What if we rethink the judgements we've been conditioned to feel when we see young women screaming their lungs out with excitement?
What if we decided to rethink the words we use to described that joy, and what if we didn't allow ourselves to diminish girls.
with words that undermine their intelligence, their interests and their capability?
You all just sounded stunning and as sane and as intelligent and as dignified as when you walked in this room.


### Signs you are wasting your life.

Life is precise and we only get one shot at it. Nevertheless, a lot of people spend their life, merely passing the time rather than making the most of the shot time they have left.
Young people are especially guilty of this -- we are springtime of our lives. If ever there was a time to plant a tree, it's now.
Yet most of us don't do that. Young people spend their time parting, eating junk food and taking vacations rather than reading, building new skill sets, building healthy habits and investing themselves.

Are you merely passing the time instead of making the most of your life? Here are some ways to tell.
- You don't get out of bed quickly upon waking. 
People who have a driving purpose in their life don't spend time lounging around on their phone in bed.
Waking up is no big deal, just start of another random day. To someone with a purpose, waking up every morning is a refreshing welcome to another day of hard yet meaningful work.

- You spend more than one hour or two a day on aimless activities. Some activities are inherently aimless, done only because they are pleasing in the moment. 
Some activities like this are: Spending time on social media, watching TV or movie and playing video games.
These kind of activities can be an important part of decompressing. Anymore than that, though, and you are going beyond 'decompressing' into 'wasting your life'.
People with a purpose don't spend too long doing these sorts of things, because they are aware that every hour sucked away by aimless activities.
The sought of wasting that much of time make them sick.

- You don't feel ready for deb at the end of each day. People whose days are filled with purposeful activities. 
feel tired at the end of the day. Whether it's mental work or physical work, purposeful activity uses up all of your energy
and leaves of you ready to go to bed each day. When you aren't making the most of your life, on the other hand, you're not tired 
at the end of the day. You are, quite literally, not making the most of your energy.

- You spend more of your time planning than doing. If you spend more of your time daydreaming, planning or thinking about the future,
that you do working to bring about that future. You are not making the most of your life. People who make something of themselves, pick
a goal for the future and then work hard to make that goal happen.

- You worry what others think of you. High achievers are too busy getting things done to worry others think of them. High achievers 
may worry about what people who matter think of them, but they don't worry about what their friends, family or pop culture thinks.
