### Slow your time

If you are luck enough to decide to pace that you want to travel through your life, it's a privilege.

You might decide that you need both to speed up and to create slow time, time to reflect, to percolate at your own pace.

### How to declutter your mind

I believe we are responsible for creating the moments of joy in our own life.

We can't take credit for a beautiful sunrise, but we can take credit for being there to see it.

That's why I am very excited to be here today to share some of what I've learned with you.

What people have the capacity to choose they have ability to change. 

Declutter your mind by creating a mental inventory. Get rid of the things that don't matter.

Focus on things that interest you by designing small actionable projects.

Get into a daily habit of updating your mental inventory.

The intentional life has the power to grant you more of those beautiful moments in the sun.


### How to move through insecurities

I've always believed that to feel really good about ourselves it's important as I call it to be lit up in life.

I moved through insecurities and tapped into that passion and purpose.

All to search for life meaning, I was lonely.

If you were able to acknowledge those negative thoughts and let them go, and then turn the volume 
and the noise down.

What would you open up for you and what would be possible? Unlimited possible, no speed limit.

I encourage you to take time out every day for self-reflection. 


### How do we break free of our habitual negative bias of our brain towards stressful state?

Generally, stress refers to tension, but angry, fear, hurt, loneliness, frustration are all stressful state.

Beautiful state is a state of connection, joy, love, compassion, vitality and passion.

If you are not a beautiful state, your default state is stress.

If you look at the entirety of human life, behind war or peace, cooperation or corrosive politics,
love or separation, persistence or failure behind all these is the driving force of these two states.

In a beautiful state, there is no compulsive illumination f the past or anxiety over the future.

It's a state where experience inner simplicity and a brilliance of an uncluttered mind.

Realizing that all lingering and suffering is a total preoccupation with oneself. That's an obsessive self-centric thinking, is the
most powerful antidote.

Paying more attention to yourself leads to disconnection from others and always tangles the past or fears the future,
which is the source of stress. Focus more on other things and experience the feelings of others that needed.

### We all see the world through our mind's eyes.

But if you asked the person on your left, they might have said regret and skepticism, and if you asked
somebody on your right, they might have said somethings entirely different, like hope or empathy.

Perception is subjective. What we think we see is actually filtered through our own mind's eye.

So to begin to track this questions, my research team and I decide to delve deeply into an issue that have received international attention:
our health and fit.

Across the world, people are struggling to manage their weight and their is a variety of strategies.

Keeping your eyes on the price, made the exercise look and feel easier, even when people were working hard because they were moving faster.

We all see the world through our own mind's eye, but we can teach ourselves to see it differently.

In some days, It might look like the world is a dangerous and challenging and insurmountable place, but It does't 
have to look that way all the time. We can teach ourselves to see it differently, and when we find a way to make the world look nice and easier.

### Objectives and Key Results

We are at a critical moment, our leader and some instruction haven't taken us to the wrong objectives.

How are we going to choose the right course?

They set meaningful and audacious goals, the right goals for the right reasons.

It almost doesn't matter what you know, execution is what matters the most.

Objectives and Key Results, or OKRs, are a simple goal-setting system and they work for organizations, they work for teams,
they even work for individuals.

The objectives are what you want to have accomplished. The key results are how I'm going to get the done.

A lot of organizations set objectives and meet them, they ship their sales, they introduce their new products, they make their numbers.
but they lack a sense of purpose to inspire their teams. 

OKRs cultivate the madness, and magic is right around the corner. That is perfect.

A good results are specific and time-bound. They are aggressive but realistic. They are measurable, and they're verifiable.

These are not used for bonuses or for promotions. They used for the high purpose and that's go to the collective commitment to truly stretch goals.

OKRs are not a sliver bullet. They're not going to be a substitute for a strong culture or for strong leadership, but when those fundamentals are 
in place, they can take you to the mountaintop.

Let's fight for what it is that really matters, because we can take OKRs beyond our business. We can take them to our families, to our schools, even to our governments.

We can transform those information. We can back to the right track, if we can and do measure what really matters. 

### The hidden power of smile

When I was a child, I always wanted to be a superhero. I wanted to save the world and make everyone happy.

I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science, to find a more useful truth.

The researchers found that the span of a player's smile could actually predict the span of his life.

Smiling is one of the most basic, biologically uniform expressions of all humans.

We smile often, and use smiles to express joy and satisfaction.

Outside of this room, more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day, whereas less than 14 percent of us smile.

By showing that facial feedback, modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain, in a way that helps us feel better when we smile.

Smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate, a well-regarded pleasure inducer can not match.

When you smile, you don't only appear to be more likable and courteous, but you actually appear to be more competent.

So whenever you want to look great and competent, reduce your stress, or improve your marriage, 
that will help you and everyone around you live a longer, healthier, happier life, smile.  


### How disease spread all around the world?

We live in an interconnected, an increasingly globalized world. Thanks international jet travel, people and the disease they carry
can be in any city on the planet in a matter of hours.

And once a virus touches down, sometimes all it takes is one sneeze to speed the infection throughout the community.

When humans were hunter-gatherers, roaming the wild savannas, we were never in one place long enough, and settlement were 
not large enough to sustain the transmission of infectious microbes.

In the Middle East, people began living side-by-side animals, facilitating the spread of bacteria and viruses between cattle and humans.

But the most common cause of epidemics are viruses, such as measles, influenza and HIV. And we they go global, we call them pandemics.

The first indication of the pandemic came in Spring, when American troops in northern France began complaining of chills, headaches and fever.

He was harboring a new animal-origin virus called SARS, short for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.

SARS was a reminder that pandemics have always been associated with panic.

If history teaches us anything, it's that while pandemics may start small, their impacts can be as dramatic
as wars and natural disasters.

The different today is that science gives us the ability to detect pandemics right at the very beginning 
and to take action to mitigate their impacts before they spread too widely.
