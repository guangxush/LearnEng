### Slow your time

If you are luck enough to decide to pace that you want to travel through your life, it's a privilege.

You might decide that you need both to speed up and to create slow time, time to reflect, to percolate at your own pace.

### How to declutter your mind

I believe we are responsible for creating the moments of joy in our own life.

We can't take credit for a beautiful sunrise, but we can take credit for being there to see it.

That's why I am very excited to be here today to share some of what I've learned with you.

What people have the capacity to choose they have ability to change. 

Declutter your mind by creating a mental inventory. Get rid of the things that don't matter.

Focus on things that interest you by designing small actionable projects.

Get into a daily habit of updating your mental inventory.

The intentional life has the power to grant you more of those beautiful moments in the sun.


### How to move through insecurities

I've always believed that to feel really good about ourselves it's important as I call it to be lit up in life.

I moved through insecurities and tapped into that passion and purpose.

All to search for life meaning, I was lonely.

If you were able to acknowledge those negative thoughts and let them go, and then turn the volume 
and the noise down.

What would you open up for you and what would be possible? Unlimited possible, no speed limit.

I encourage you to take time out every day for self-reflection.
